Therefore, Doug had 3 marbles initially. But then lost 20 marbles at the playground and ended up with 17, so we need to subtract that from E to find out how many marbles Doug has now.

We can use the second equation to substitute the first equation into the second equation: E - 20 = 17 Add 20 to both sides: E - 20 = D + 12 Divide both sides by 12: D = 5 Therefore, Doug now has 5 marbles. We can use the second equation to solve for D: E - 20 = 17 - 15 = 17 - 20 Substitute the first equation into the second equation: 17 - 20 = 16 - 20 = 17 - 5 So Ed had 20 marbles and ended up with 17.

Therefore, we can set up an equation: 2x = 6 To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 6 - 6 x = 2 This equation says that each book costs $2. We also know from the problem that the cost of one book is $12. We can check this answer by using the equation for the total cost of each book: 1 = 12 Divide both sides by 12: x = -1 This doesn't make sense since each book costs $6 and we can't afford a fraction of a book. To check our answer, we can calculate the total cost of each book: 2  12 = 12 Dividing both sides by 2, we find that each book cost $1, which is a reasonable and is reasonable.",

So, we can write: x - 4 = 19 (Steven has 19 apples) We want to find how many peaches Steven has, so we can write an equation: 19 - 15 = -3 This means that Steven has three more apples than peaches. To find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has, we can subtract the number of peaches from the number of apples: 19 - 3 = 15 Now we can substitute the value of x into the equation: 19 + 4 = 15 Simplifying: x - 15 = 3 So, Steven has three more apples than peaches.",

We can simplify this by subtracting 8 from both sides: x = 8 So the waiter initially had 13 customers, but before some left. To check our answer, we can verify that this answer is the total number of customers: 13 - x = 8 So the waiter initially had 8 customers.

We also know that she had 495 Ace cards left. So we can write an equation: x + 495 = 456 This equation represents the fact that Nell gave some to Jeff, so we can write: x + 456 = 495 Now we solve for x: x + 495 = 276 Therefore, Nell has 246 baseball cards. We also know that she gave some to Jeff, so we can write: x + 495 = 456 (cards given to Jeff) Simplifying: x + 256 = 495 Ace cards Solving for x, we get: x = 495 - 456 Solving for x, we get: x = 256 So Nell has 256 Ace cards left. We also know that she ended up with 495 Ace cards, so we can set up an equation: x + 256 = 495 Ace cards - 356 Ace cards = 495 Ace cards So Nell has 246 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards left. We can use this information to solve for x: x + 495 Ace cards = 495 Ace cards - Baseball cards = 495 Ace cards Therefore, Nell has 495 Ace cards and baseball cards.

We can check our answer by using the problem again. If each book costs the same amount of money, and he spent $16, we can verify that the cost of each book would be the same as he did. We also know that the cost of each book was 16: 16/92 = 92 If each book costs the same amount, we can use this to solve for the cost of each book: 92  4 = $6 And if we assume that each book cost him $16 and each book cost him $42, we can assume he spent $16 to buy 92 books, which is the amount he did spend $16 to buy 92 books.",

Therefore, there's no solution to this problem. It's clear that the problem has been addressing the question as it's stated doesn't say how many cups of flour she has already put in. We can't say how many more cups of flour she needs to add, so let's use the information from the problem to find the number of cups of flour she still needs to add. We can verify this answer: If Mary still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, she needs to add: 8 cups - 13 cups = -2 cups So Mary has already put in 2 cups of flour, and she has already put in 3 cups, which means she has already put in 3 cups but that she has only put in 3 cups which is also 3 cups.",

She knows there will be 4 groups, so if she doesn't mind cutting the corners, she will have 2 eggs in each group. But the problem also mentioned that she has 6 marbles, which means she's going to split them into 4 groups. So the number of marbles she has doesn't need to be divided into 4 groups, so if you add the number of groups she wants to be dividing evenly between the 4 groups, it means we need to multiply 8 to 4: 8 eggs  4 groups = 2 eggs per group Therefore, each group will have 2 eggs.",

        "chain": "Let's start by using algebra to solve for the frog's jump distance. Let frog jump distance + 4 inches = 29 inches. The mouse jump distance - 44 inches = -15 inches. Now we need to solve for the frog's jump distance. We know that the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, so we can set up an equation: 19 = frog's jump distance + 4 We also know that the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog, so we need to add that to the distance the grasshopper's jump distance: 19 = frog's jump distance + 4 We can solve for the frog's jump distance using the equation: 19 + 4 = frog's jump distance + 4 Simplifying: 19 - 44 = frog's jump distance + 4 We can solve for the frog's jump distance by subtracting 4 from both sides: frog's jump distance - 4 = 0 Substituting in for the frog's jump distance, we get: frog's jump distance + 4 = frog's jump distance + frog's jump distance + 4 = 35 Therefore, the frog jumped 35 inches.",
