Now we can use the variable \"x\" to represent the number of stations they visited, which is \"x\". We know that Joline and the junior ranger must have used 7 nails in each of the 140 nails they used.

Therefore, the shop sold a total of 240 pairs of shoes, including 22 pairs of large-size shoes, 50 pairs of medium-size shoes, and 24 pairs of small-size shoes.",

To find out how many students and teachers there are in the partially occupied bus, we can subtract 12 from the total number of students and teachers: 1,230 - 132 = 9 So there are 9 students and teachers that are going on the field trip with a total of 9 buses, totaling 9 buses carrying 1,230 students and teachers going on a field trip.",

We know that the fruits can be spread out evenly among the large and small trucks. We can use substitution to solve for t: 15t = 134 - 7t = 7t So we'll need to make sure that the small trucks are occupied. This means that we can use 8 large trucks and 1 small truck to load 134 tons of Mr. Lee's fruits, while the large truck can carry 15 tons of fruit.

Next, let's find out how many small trucks are needed to carry out the total number of tons: 15 tons  7 tons per truck = 134 tons Now let's find the minimum number of trucks needed. We can do this by using the first number of large and then use the second number of small trucks: 15 tons - 7 tons per truck = 134 - 15 tons = 134/7 = 1 So Mr. Lee needs to use at least 1 to haul 134 tons of his fruits. Since we want to use the least number of trucks possible and have every truck fully occupied, we want to minimize the number of trucks used. However, we can't have a partial truck, so we need to round down to 1. We know that we need to use at least 1 small truck to haul 134 tons of Mr. Lee's fruit. If we had 1 small truck, we could use 1 small truck to carry the remaining fruits. If we try using 1 small truck, we'd need 1 to haul 134 tons of Mr. Lee's fruits. If we try 1 small truck, we'd need 3 large trucks, which we'd need 1 small truck to haul the full 134 tons of fruits. However, in this case, we end up with 1 small truck, which does not work since we only need 1 small truck. This could mean using 2 large trucks and 1 small truck.

        "chain": "To find the least number of groups possible, we want to minimize the number of members in each group. Since we want to split 90 members into groups of 7 members each, we need to find a way to evenly distribute those 90 members among the 7 groups. One way to do this is to list out all the possible combinations of 7 members and 3 members: 7 + 3 = 90  7 = 15 So we can evenly distribute 15 members among 15 groups of 7 members each, with 1 member left over. To find out how many small groups we can form: 7/7 = 2 So we can form 2 groups of 3 members each, with 1 member left over. We can also create 2 groups of 3 members each as follows: 7  3 = 2 So we can form 2 groups of 3 members each, with 1 member left over. We can then create 2 groups of 3 members each, with 1 member left over. To find out how many groups we can make, we can divide the total number of members by the number of members in each group: 2  3 = 5 So we can form 5 groups of 3 members each, with 1 member left over. However, since we want to make the least number of groups possible, we have 2 groups of 3 members each. So we can form 5 groups of 7 members each, with 1 member left over. Alternatively, we can use the fact that we can form 90 members and 5 small groups of 3 members each. We can also use substitution to solve for the remaining members: - 9 groups of 3 members each = 5 groups of 3 members - 5 groups of 7 members each - 3 groups of 3 members each = 7 - 1 group of 3 members We can solve for the remainder: 7 + 1 = 5 x 3 = 15 - 2 x 7 = 15 x 3 = 4 So the least number of groups possible is 5, with 1 remaining.",

Therefore, we need to make sure that we have enough members to form at least 6 groups of 7 members each. Since we have 90 members, we can only form 7 groups of 7 members each. We need to figure out how many groups of 7 members we can form. For example: - If we form 2 groups of 7 members (which is the total number of members), we can form: 7 groups of 7 members x 2 members per group = 24 groups of 3 dancers We can also create 2 groups of 3 dancers each (each group of 3 dancers). Alternatively, we can use the concept of a \"n\" group of 7 dancers each, for example, to form 9 large groups of 7 dancers each. This would leave us with: - If we form 2 groups of 7 dancers each (totalling 7 dancers) - If we form 5 large groups of 7 dancers each (totaling 6 dancers) and 2 small groups of 3 dancers each (totaling) we get: - 8  3 = 6 - If we form 9 groups of 3 dancers each, we can form 2 groups of 3 dancers each (total of 9) and 2 small groups of 3 dancers each (8 dancers each) - We can form 9 groups of 3 dancers each - And we can form 9 groups of 7 dancers each (totaling: - We can form a total of: - We have 6 large groups of 7 dancers each and 2 small groups of 3 dancers each - We can form 9 groups of 3 dancers each - We can form 9 groups of 7 dancers each - We can form 9 groups of 7 dancers each - We can form 9 groups of 7 dancers each - We are left with no dancers left over.

Next, we can use the GCF to find the factors that are shared by all 3: 45 + 81 + 63 = 9 Therefore, the greatest number of plants that can be put in one row is 9.

To find how many apples are in the third bag together, we can add the number of apples in both bags: a + b + c = 12 a + b = 13 Therefore, there are 13 apples in the first and third bags together.",

According to the problem, the ducks travel in flocks of 18, so Heather could have observed x/18 ducks. We also know that Heather observed the same total number of seagulls, so she must have observed y/10 seagulls. We also know that Heather observed the same total number of ducks and seagulls. Let's call the number of seagulls \"y\" and the number of ducks \"d\" (we can't have a partial flock of ducks) to \"y\" (since we want to find the smallest possible value of y that is y). The smallest possible value for y that satisfies this equation is y = 18 (since the total number of ducks per flock is 18 birds) and y must be 10. Thus, the smallest possible value of x that satisfies this equation is 18x = 10y. The smallest possible value for x that satisfies this equation is 18. To check that the equation is correct, we can use the following equation: 18x = 10y = 10y = 10y x = 18y = 10y = 18(18x/18) = 10y = 10y y = 10y = 10y - 3y = 2y = 10y y = 18y = 10y = 18y = 10y y = 10 So Heather observed 10 flocks of ducks and 10 flocks of seagulls, totaling 18 flocks of ducks and 10 flocks of seagulls. We can check if this is correct by confirming that Heather observed a total of 18 ducks and 10 seagulls, and she observed the same total number of ducks and seagulls.",

Let's use variables to represent the values of each coin: Let's call the number of coins \"q\" and the number of coins \"d\". We know that Kira has $1.20 in total, so we can set up an equation: q + d = 1.20 We also know that Kira has quarters and dimes: q + d = 1.20 We can simplify this equation by subtracting 1.20 from both sides: d = 0.40 This means that we can make a complete set of quarters and dimes as 1 of the coins. If Kira only has quarters, we would need a total of 11 quarters and 2 dimes. Since we have a total of $1.20, we can only have 1 coin. Now let's try the other side: d = 1.20 - 1.40 - 0.40 = 5.60 - 3.10 = 2.40 This means that Kira has 5 coins, and the smallest possible combination is 1, which means she only has 5 coins.

On Sunday, Jemma filled the remaining three-fourths of the barrel with compost. We know that Sunday's addition added 4200 g, so we can set up an equation: 3/4x = 3/4 To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 1000: 3/4x = 4200 g So there is a total of 5600 g of compost in the barrel after Saturday. To find the total amount of compost in the barrel, we need to add the amount Jemma added on Saturday to the amount she added on Sunday: 3/4x + 4200 g = 5600 g Therefore, the total amount of compost in the barrel is 5600 g.",

Let's use the second Saturday addition to find out how much compost Jemma added on Sunday: 7500 g - 400 g = 7500 g So Jemma added 7500 g of compost on Sunday. To find out how much compost Jemma added on Saturday and Sunday, we can add the amount added on Saturday to the Sunday addition: 7500 g + 4200 g = 7500 g So the Sunday addition added 7500 g of compost.

To calculate the total number of cookies per container, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of containers: 30 oatmeal cookies  5 containers = 3 containers 48 chocolate chip cookies  5 containers per container = 5 containers So Kiara will need 5 containers in total to store her oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies.",

So we can plug in R to get rid of the interpolation: K = 4R We can solve for R by dividing both sides by 4: K = 4R We get rid of K by 4 and 4R = R This solves for R.

        "chain": "Let's call the length of the shortest side \"x\". According to the problem, the perimeter of a triangle is 90 cm. Therefore, we can create three sets of equal sides with a perimeter of 90 cm. So let's label the sides with the numbers 5 and 12 and the number 13, since we want to find the lengths of all three sets of equal sides. The perimeter of the triangle = 90 cm The perimeter of the triangle = 90 cm / 3 = 90 cm Now we can solve for the lengths of the three sides. One way to do so is to subtract the perimeter from the length of the other two sides: 90 cm - 60 cm = 90 cm - 60 cm = 90 cm Now we can use the ratio 5:12:13:13 = 60 cm / 3 = 60 cm So the length of the shortest side is 60 cm. We can check that the lengths of the other sides (which is 60 cm) is 90 cm. If we multiply 60 by 3, we get 90 cm, and 60 cm = 90 cm, so we can be confident that the sides are in the ratio 5:12:13:15 cm = 60 cm  3 = 90 cm So if we add 60 cm to 60 cm, we get 90 cm = 60 cm.",

To calculate how many more uniforms they need to buy, we subtract the total number of uniforms they already have from the number of uniforms they need: 927 - 927 = -1 This means the store owner needs to buy 1 more uniform so they don't have any extra uniforms left over.",

First, we can find out how much Amy's dad spent on the adults by adding the cost of the adults' meal to the cost of the kids' meal: 5 dollars for the adults + 5 dollars for the kids = $10 For the adults, we can add the cost of the adults' meal to the cost of the kids' meal: $10 + $5 = $15 Therefore, it cost a total of $15 for everyone to eat out. Another way to check our answer is to add the cost of Amy's dad's birthday dinners to the cost of Amy's dad's birthday party: $15 + $15 = $10 This confirms that Amy's dad spent $10 for her birthday, including the cost of the adults's meal.",

Start with the total number of people at the party (13) and subtract the number of people who dressed up (6): 13 - 6 = 7 So, there were 7 people at John's Halloween party who did not dress up in costumes. Another way to approach this problem is to use proportional reasoning. If we assume that 6 people dressed up in costumes (which we don't know anything about the Halloween partygoers), we can say that 6 people didn't dress up in costumes (since 6 people usually don't wear costumes). Subtract the number of people who dressed up (6) from the total number of people (13). 13 - 6 = 7 So, there were 7 people at John's Halloween party who didn't wear costumes.",

We can solve for the original number of birds in the cage by adding the number of birds back to 10: Birds originally in the cage = Birds originally in the cage - Birds still inside Equation 1: Original number of birds in the cage = Birds Original number of birds + Birds in cage = 10 Birds in cage = 10 Birds original number = 9 Birds in cage = 10 Birds in cage - 9 Birds = 10 Birds in cage = 10 Birds in cage = 10 Birds in cage = 9 Birds in cage = 10 Birds still inside Equation 2: Birds in cage Added Birds in cage = 10 Birds left inside Equation 2 x 9 Birds = 10 Birds in cage = 11 Therefore, there were 11 birds in the cage to start with.",

To find the mean (or average), we add up all the numbers: 13, 8, 13, 8, 13, 13, 21, 7, 7, and 23. Adding up all the numbers: 13, 8, 13, 8, 13, 8, 13, 13, 7, and 23, we get: 13, 8, 13, 21, 7, and 23. To find the mean (also known as the sum), we add up the sum of 7, 7, 7, 7, and 23: 13, 8, 13, 28, 35, 43, 45, 54, 63, 70, 77, 88, 92, 98, 104, 112, 153, 165, 187, 220, 187, 203, 204, 205, 207, 216, 203, 217, 207, 204, 222, 243, 217, 207, 218, 222, 220, 222, 243, 235, 222, 222, 243, 243, 252, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 251, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 250, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 244, 281, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243, 243",

        "chain": "Let's call the number of times Miranda has been to the store \"x\". According to the problem, Miranda plans to spend $7 each time she goes to the store. Therefore, Savannah's total spending is also 7. We can show that 7 is the least possible value of x. We also know that Miranda and Savannah have spent the exact same total amount of money at the store. Therefore, we can set up an equation: 7x = 9(x) To solve for x, we first isolate x on 1 side of the equation. We can then isolate x by dividing both sides by 9: 7x = 63 However, we also know that Miranda and Savannah have spent the exact same amount of money at the store. We can check this by plugging in 63 and 9: 63 = 9 So the least possible value of x that Miranda has been to the store is 9. So we know that Miranda has spent $73 at least 9 times.",

Now we need to find the x and y such that their steps are: y = 75 x = 15 cm To find the minimum distance each should walk, we need to find the smallest values of y and x that satisfy this equation. We can use algebra to solve for x: x = 5y = 90 x = 3 Now let's find the y value of x that makes the equation true. Since we want to find the minimum value of x, we need to find y such that: x = 15 y = 90 y = 15 Now we need to find the smallest value of y that is a whole number. We can use y = 75 y = 9y = 45 y = 90 x = 75 y = 75 y = 90 y = 90 y = 90 x = 75 y = 90 y = 45 x = 90 y = 90 y = 90 x = 90 y = 90 y = 45 We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 45: y = 180 x = 45 y = 90 y = 45 So each person should walk at least 45 cm (i.e., 75  90 = y = 90), so that they can cover the same distance in complete steps.",

We can write these values together as follows: x = distance traveled by P / x = distance traveled by Q / (x 3) x = distance traveled by Q We can use the fact that when P and Q will meet again at the starting point, x = x and y = y = y (i.e.x y - x - y = 9) We can use the fact that they traveled x = distance traveled by Q.

To find y, we need to find the smallest multiple of x and y that is less than 252 and 198. This is 252 x = 252 seconds. To find y, we can use the following expression: x = (y) * t = y * x = 252 (x - 252) * y = 198 y = x * y = 252 y = 252 x = y * 198 (y - 252) * y = 252 y = 198 y = 7772 Thus, when P and Q meet again at the starting point, they will take 7792 seconds.",

To do this, we can add up the number of arrangements of each type of flower: 8 + 12 + 48 = 3 So there are 3 arrangements of 8 roses, 12 daisies, and 48 marigolds. To find out how many arrangements of those 3 flowers, we can divide each type of flower by 3: 8 + 12 + 48 = 96 Therefore, Jessica can make 96 arrangements of all of these flowers.",

        "chain": "To solve the problem, we can use basic algebra. Let's start by setting up an equation: x = 4 ounces of cheese for each burrito (since there are 7 burritos to make) + y = 1 taco (since there are 9 ounces of cheese for the taco) Now we can solve for x: 7(oz) = 4(9 oz) x = 18 Therefore, for 7 burritos and 1 taco, you would need 18 ounces of cheese. Alternatively, you can use substitution to solve for x: 7(8 ounces for burritos) + 1(9 ounces for taco) = 38 ounces of cheese Then, you can substitute these values into the original equation for x: 7(38 ounces) + 1 (38 ounces) = 37 ounces of cheese This simplifies to 34 ounces of cheese. Then, you can add the 3 quantities to get the total amount needed: 7(38 ounces) + 1(38 ounces) = 37 ounces of cheese Therefore, for 7 burritos and 1 taco, you would need 37 ounces of cheese (4 ounces + 9 ounces).",

Similarly, for a taco (9 ounces/taco): 9 ounces/taco x 1 taco = 9 ounces of cheese X 2 = 37 ounces of cheese. Therefore, 7 burritos and 1 taco would require 37 ounces of cheese.",

Therefore, for 7 burritos, we would need 28 ounces of cheese. For 1 taco, we can use 9 ounces of cheese. Finally, to calculate the total amount of cheese needed for 7 burritos and 1 taco: 28 ounces x 7 burritos = 37 ounces So, in total, we would need 37 ounces of cheese for 7 burritos and 1 taco.",
