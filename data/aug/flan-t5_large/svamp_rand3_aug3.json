To arrive at this answer, we first need to determine how many cups of each ingredient are needed for the recipe (since 11 cups of sugar + 9 cups of salt = 16 cups of ingredients needed). Since Mary already added 12 cups of flour to the batter, she still needs to add 6 cups of flour, leaving her with 6 - 12 = -6 cups of flour. Since this is not possible, we can substitute the value of \"flour\" in the above equation to find the amount of flour needed. Since the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 9 cups of salt to be used, we substitute this value of \"flour\" into the above equation to find the amount of water needed. Assuming this value of \"flour\" is correct, we can now substitute the value of \"flour\" in the above equation to find the amount of water needed: 11 cups of sugar - 9 cups of salt = 8 cups of water needed. Therefore, Mary needs to add 8 cups of water to reach the required 11 cups of sugar, and 9 cups of salt. To determine how many more cups of sugar than salt she needs to add, we subtract the amounts of salt and flour needed from the amount of sugar required.

        "chain": "To solve this problem, we need to use a simple mathematical equation. Let x be the number of bottle caps Danny had at first. According to the problem, Danny found 22 bottle caps and 8 wrappers at the park. Therefore, his collection increased by 22 + 8 = 34 caps at the park. He now has 28 bottle caps and 63 wrappers in his collection. To find the value of x, we need to solve for x. We can do this by isolating the variable on one side of the equation: x = 28 - 22 x = 12 Therefore, Danny had 12 bottle caps at first. He then found 22 bottle caps and 8 wrappers at the park. So his collection increased by 22 + 8 = 44 caps at the park. Therefore, his collection increased by 44 + 8 = 68 caps at the park. To find the value of x, we can solve for x: x = 22 - 22 x = 12 Therefore, Danny had 12 bottle caps at first. He then found 22 bottle caps and 8 wrappers at the park. So his collection increased by 22 + 8 = 48 caps at the park. So his collection increased by 48 + 8 = 68 caps at the park. So his collection increased by 28 - 48 = 63 caps at the park.

        "chain": "Let's start by setting up an equation for this scenario: Julia played with 4 kids on Monday. We know that the total number of kids she played with over the two days is 18. So we can write an equation to represent that: 18 = 4 + x where x represents the number of kids Julia played with on Tuesday. We also know that the total number of kids she played with over the two days is 18. Setting this equal to the number of kids Julia played with on Tuesday, we can solve for x: 18 - 4 = 14 Therefore, Julia played with 14 kids on Tuesday.",

However, since we can't have a negative speed, we can say that their final destination is located at the top of the cave system, which is located at the top of the cave system. Therefore, we can set up another equation to represent their final destination: 369 feet  17 feet/minute = 369 feet Therefore, they still need to travel 369 feet, which is a distance that doesn't make sense to ignore.
