Since one friend cannot ride, we know that: - Number of friends going = amount of friends to be taken (8) - Trip (friends going) = number of friends going (8) If there are 7 friends remaining, this information tells us that they will not be going to the movies. Therefore, we know that we must take at least 8 friends, which leaves us with: 15 - 8 = 5.

By default, we choose m1, which represents the amount we are trying to find. But with this particular question, we have no parameters to choose on; we need only to specify what variable we want to solve for. When we give 1 to 2 options as m1, we get 1. Therefore, m1 = (m1/2) + (m2/2) + 1 = 3, when we have choices pertaining to m1, we choose 1 in place of the other given variable. Either method yields the same result: m1 = (3 miles - 2 miles = 3) m2 = (2 miles - 2 miles = 2 miles OR, we have a choice here! If we use variables to represent individual miles...: m1, we =>= (m2/2) + (m2/2) We use variables, m1 = (3 miles - 2 miles = m2 Then, the whole numbers oply into the equation: m1 = (3 miles - 2 miles = 2), oply into'm2/2) Simplifying: m2 = 12 m2 = 11 Therefore, the overall mileage Mrs. Hilt ran that week is 15.5 miles.",

Therefore, it's common practice to round these additions up to the nearest whole number to arrive at an accurate answer.

        "chain": "If we subtract the 16 Valentines Mrs. Franklin has left from the total of 58 Valentines that she started with, we can use subtraction: 58 - 16 = 42 So Mrs. Franklin gave 42 Valentines to her students. Alternatively, we could calculate using subtraction: Let x be the number of Valentines Mrs. Franklin gave to her students. We know that Mrs. Franklin started with 58 Valentines and ended up with 16, so: 58 - x = 16 Using subtraction: 42 = x However, since 42 is the smaller number, we know that Mrs. Franklin gave 42 cards to her students. This gives us the same result! So it's worth exploring another column or subtraction to check our answer: For example, if we start by finding x in a subtraction problem, we can use simple subtraction to bring in a whole number. We can add 2 to the number of cards Mrs. Franklin did give, like this: 22 + x = 58 That checks out! So we can substitute that value for that equation: 23 + x = 16 + x = 58 That matches the original statement from the problem. Therefore, our answer checks out!",

Let F be the number of stickers he added, and let C be the number he added. Now, we can write both expressions with variables, but let's simplify them using a combination of numbers: $$ 79 = $0.25$ $$ It's worth noting that this expression is an approximation of the number of stickers Hugo carried around, but it also indicates that he had an additional amount of stickers on the back of his book. Depending on how the calculation goes, this value may or may not be accurate. In general, we would expect Hugo to change C quantities at some point, perhaps once he started carrying around 99 stickers, either in real life or in imagination. But given the current amount of 50 stickers he has, this equation may not make sense. Therefore, we move on to another problem. The difference between the two numbers could be written as the value of 79 + C that Hugo added to his book. The final answer could be the same as the original calculation, but with the addition of C ($19), we don't know what value he introduced to F and what value he carried along. $$ 79 + 0.25 = 100 $$ So the actual calculation would be 79 + 0.25(100) = 99 - C.$ However, this assumes that Hugo already carried around the same amount of stickers throughout the book, so it's likely that the actual amount he added simply wasn't significant enough to change the ending value of C.

Since Lucy has 31 more snowballs than Charlie, we can add 31 to Lucy's amount: 19 + 31 = 50 So, Lucy has 50 snowballs. Now let's check our work to confirm that Charlie has 50 snowballs. We know that Lucy has 19 snowballs, so: Charlie's Snowballs = Lucy's Snowballs + 31 Charlie's Snowballs = 19 Snowballs + 31 We don't have enough information to tell us exactly how many snowballs Charlie has, so we are not provided with any additional information, which could cause us to change our answer. But our problem tells us already that Charlie has 31 in addition to Lucy's 19, so we can assume that everything equals 19 because: Charlie's Snowballs + 31 = 19 It turns out that everything equals 19 according to the problem, so we can assume that all of Lucy's snowballs add up to 19 before we subtract 31: 19 - 31 = 50 Which is false because it implies that Charlie has 31 more snowballs than Lucy.",

        "chain": "Andrew took a total of 90 appetizer pieces. To start, we need to determine how many hotdogs were brought. Assuming all 30 hotdogs were included, the number of portioned hotdogs would be 30  2 = 12. For the 20 cheese pops, we would divide them into sections of 3 or 4. In this case, we would use multiplication to figure out how many portions we have. If there are 3 groups of 4 hotdogs and 4 other related items, then 24 (4 hotdog portions with 2 hotdog portions) portions would be taken. If there are 22 hotdogs and 36 cheese pops, then we would take 12 hotdogs (24/1 = 9 in portions) and 14 cheese pops (4/3) portions would make up the remaining portions. This leaves us with 12 hotdogs (24/15 = 3.36) portions and 16 cheese pops (12/8 = 0.47). So as you can see, Andrew brought 22 portions in all (9 hotdogs + 13 cheese pops + 21 chicken nugget portions), but if we just counted the portions of each appetizer, we wouldn't be able to count them all separately: For example, let's count 10 hotdog portions (because we have 9 hotdogs and 1/4 cheese), which would bring down to 5 portions (because 21/3 = 14. Then the remaining portions would be 20 hotdog portions (because 22/5 = 4 i.e. 2 portions), and we could count 2 hotdog portion(11/18 = 2.17 and another portion would bring down to 12 hotdog portions), so I wouldn't count any other portion(15/25 or 15/40 of any kind).

Also, remember that when dividing a large party into smaller portions, it's always important to divide by the largest possible number of appetizer pieces rather than the number of appetizers per portion. - In this case, to determine a reasonable number to portion ratio (i.e. hotdogs, cheese pops, and chicken nuggets), you need to know how many people are partying and if there are any leftovers or leftovers that could be used for an additional appetizer. - Therefore, 30 appetizer pieces (either 30 hotdogs or 10 cheese pops), 21 appetizer pieces (either 20 cheese pops or 10 chicken nuggets), and 4 appetizer portions (either 4 chicken nuggets or 6 other types, as appropriate) are sufficient to fulfill the request of catering to large groups of guests.",

To get this answer, you simply add up the numbers of species she captured in each category: 60 +15 +20 = 95 There were different ways of approaching this problem, but one method is to think ahead and write down what you're getting into, rather than identifying the individual items. Ultimately, Penny captured 95 species. In summary: - Species of butterflies: 60 - Species of ants: 15 - Species of other insects: 20 So Penny captured a total of 95 species of insects, which included 60 butterfly species, 15 ant species, and 20 other insect species. It's important to note that this method is a technique used to track the movement of insects and is useful when trying to capture a variety of different frames of reference. For example, if Penny wanted to recapture a particular butterfly wing or insect pattern, she could have used different pictures, e.g., the one taken earlier might show different colors of butterflies, whereas the more formal method would likely show butterflies with different colors.",

The planting of new trees adds to the overall community's resilience and provides opportunities for new wildlife to thrive. By planting new trees, the rangers also contribute to ensuring that there are fewer trees on the land that are vulnerable to invasive species and natural hazards, such as foxes and rabbits.",

The problem tells us that Buddy was enrolled in an exercise class, which means that he must be in two groups. But we don't have enough information to determine those two groups' numbers separately (or in some cases, separately). Let's use mental arithmetic to find the answer. For example, we can use a table to represent the number of students in one group, (34), and add the number of students in the other group (37). This way, we can arrive at their values without further questioning. - The answer for groups 2 (34 + 37) will be 34 times, which appears as 63.

This means that there are two different approaches to solving this problem. One approach is to use ratios. We know that cats make up about 17% of the animal population, and dogs make up 17%. Therefore, we can assume that cat numbers will keep increasing by 1 in this scenario while at the same time, while dogs will continue to increase by 1 in this scenario, despite being divided into a different group. Assuming the proportions were: total number of cats (1/2) + ratios (%) vs. x (914/18) = total number of cats |... for x! | * (not at the word \"x\") -------- 567 \"\" The problem starts with asking \"how much\" (in dollars), meaning let's subtract $567 from 645: total number of cats + ratios ----- $567 + 645 = total number of cats ----- 574 \"\" The x expressed as a fraction is $567. One would assume that those subtractions add up to a whole number that represents something other than cats and dogs, and ignores any relationships between the variables in the expressions. Therefore this approach would work as expected. However, in this particular case, taking the positive approach, the solution might have helped improve the overall situation.",

In this case, the number of drums drawn in one day is 3,14, and the number of days is 9, since 9 is a multiple of 9. Therefore, the picking process can be thought of this way: - Determine the yield per day by multiplying 324 by 9, and then subtract from 9: 3|9|314 = 2916 drums of grapes per day - Divide by 9 to get the yield over 9 days: 2916 / 9 = 324 drums of grapes per day - And summarize the answer in several ways: - Add up daily output to find total yield in 9 days: 324 (days to day) + 314 (days) + 354 (days) = 2416 drums of grapes after 9 days of working",

Therefore, figuring out how many balls are needed is important because both teams can only jug together 6 balls at a time. Another factor to consider is the logistics of having multiple jugglers juggling at the same time. If we assume that each juggler needs to work at a constant rate of 6 balls, some combinations of jugglers may not be able to perform at the same rate. Another possible solution to this problem is to pool the balls that are needed for each juggler and find a common factor: - Since it\u2019s more efficient to distribute the balls in groups (i.e. in groups), more players may be needed to account for each team\u2019s juggling time, and staff may need to use more or fewer tickets to cover for faster juggling times.

Since 30 cups and 5 glasses are divisible by 5, it would make sense to write out 15 as the remainder (since that's how many additional quarters went into the calculation). The quotient (or how many quarters were in the total) is 5, so the quotient is 5. However, since it's impossible to have a fraction of a pitcher, we just need to round up to the nearest whole number and multiply it with 7, which gives us 10. Therefore, Hannah's mother prepared 16 pitchers of lemonade.",

We start with the total number of stones Betty received and bring down: 36 stone-shaped stones x 3 bracelets = 72 stone-shaped stones Next, we have the number of stones Betty must receive to make the bracelets: Betty must receive the stones: x bracelets * 72 stones = 3 (since there are 63 stones in whole) Therefore Betty must receive: x pfb1 =bb1.sub() *(42) 32  pfb1.sub() = 36 This tells us all of the information we need to know to solve the equation. Firstly, we need for x: Then, we need to subtract 36 from both sides: 3x__ = 36 x = 6 Multiply both sides by 3 to find x: x = 18 Therefore, each of Brenda's bracelets will be made with 18 star-shaped stones.

Write down the information exactly where Susie's mother needs to put her family pictures. Writing down this information in a list or on a piece of paper can help you make more accurate and efficient calculations. 2. Add up the different sizes of pictures that can fit in an album to get a rough estimate of how many albums that would require. 480 photos divided by 20 pictures per album equals around 16 albums. 3. This assumes that Susie's mother wants an album that can hold all family pictures without any picture omissions or overlaps. In reality, it may be wiser to consider the specific amount of pictures Susie's mother needs to include and figure out how many different methods could be used to organize all that family history.

To do this, we divide the total amount of detergent (which is 2 ounces). Let's call it 2 ounces: 2 ounces of detergent/pound = 1 pound of clothes So we know that she needs 2 ounces of detergent per 1 pound of clothes, so when she starts washing 9 pounds of clothes, she will be washing the proportions of 2 ounces + 1 pound + 3 ounces of detergent : 2 ounces + 1 pound + 3 ounces of detergent = 2 ounces on both sides. Now we simply add these up to: 2 ounces + 1 pound + 3 ounces of detergent = 6 ounces of detergent To solve, we're told that Mrs. Hilt uses 2 ounces of detergent per 1 pound of clothes, and to add the 1 pound of detergent to the weight of 9 pounds of clothes (which we get here as 7 pounds). We are trying to figure out how much soap Mrs. Hilt will need to wash a total of 9 pounds of clothes, noting that the detergent she uses for one pound will be different from the proportions she needs for 9 pounds of clothes specifically.

So: 1 gallon  4 quarts = 8 cups of juice So we round down to 8. This means that there will be 8 servings if 1 gallon is divided equally into 4 quarts and 6-ounce glasses. However, if 4 quarts make each serving 36 ounces, then one gallon is more efficient than 4 quarts, which means faster serving. So if someone orders a 6-ounce glass or 18 ounce glass of juice, the same proportion should be applied to the other quarts.

Therefore, there are 3 capes left. We can break down the calculation step by step using subtraction: - Start with 8 capes: 8 total capes - 6 capes purchased = 4 remaining capes - Explanation: There are different scenarios that could involve adding 6 capes, purchasing additional capes, or deducting capes from the original order at the Halloween store. Step 1: Determine how many capes were purchased. Since 6 capes were purchased, we need to remove 6 from the initial 16 capes to see how many were sold. Taking 6 as a whole, 16 - 6 = 1.68 (7 red, blue, and green capes if purchased) Step 2: Calculate how many capes that match the initial amount. Since we only know 8 capes, we can plug that into the calculation and simplify: 8 - 6 = 1.68 Step 3: Calculate how many capes are sold. If 6 capes are bought, we need to subtract the number of capes sold to figure out how many are left. Using subtraction: There are 2 green capes left, which is 3 green capes - 1 blue cape left, which is 2 blue capes - and 3 red capes left, which is 3 red capes. Step 4: Calculate how many capes are left. Putting all of the difference together: 8 Capes purchased - 3 green capes left = 2 capes left",

Step 3: Solve for the number of beads that Tom took out by subtracting 4 from the total: 2 - 4 = 2. Therefore, Tom took out 2 beads from the container. Alternatively, we can write the problem as a function of the number of beads that Tom left in the container. If Tom left 4 beads in, we could write it an equation to represent the state of the container before Tom took some out. For example: Let x = the number of beads that Tom took out, and give it the value of 4 that Tom left in the container. Then: 2 - x = 4 Then: 4 - 4 = 4 X = 4, which represents the number of beads that Tom took out. Using this expression, we can solve for x. Since one can be sure that the values of \"x\" and \"x\" after subtracting 4 from \"x\", we obtain: 4 - [2 - x] 4 / 2 = 2. - 4 = 1 And on the other hand, substituting \"x\" for \"x\", we get: 2 - x * 2 = 4 * 2 + 2 -- 3 + 2 = 2",

We're assuming the unknown variable (x) didn't change the final number of children (the final count). However, depending on how we interpret the final count, we might be able to adjust our answer accordingly. In this case, if the number of children had gone down by 24, we could round up to get 78, which means that there would still be 78 children if the number of girls or boys had remained the same. Likewise, if there were 27 children at the bakery at first, we might be able to determine how many children were there by simply subtracting what some had left to calculate: x + 24 - 31 = 78 x - 2 = 7 x = 47 So there were 4 children at the bakery at first, and the boys left, totalling to 24 + 31 = 38 when all 4 children were left.

Alternatively, we could solve this visually by using a table or a diagram, listing out each item and identifying the starting place value of each notebook. Starting with the items we marked as starting points, we bring down the line where the total number of notebooks is listed and add up by selecting the initial value of each notebook: Number of notebooks with remaining 5. - Starting number of notebooks with remaining 6. - Starting number of notebooks with remaining notebooks from previously assigned notebooks. To see in which counts, we need to add together the numbers when we take away 5 and add them together: $$ 15 + 17 + 19 = 51 13 + 17 + 19 = 52 $$ Therefore, this equals the starting number of notebooks with 5 left.

Decide how many washing cycles are needed to wash up to 200 pounds of clothes. If you are washing clothes only once per day, you will need to adjust the number of washing cycles accordingly. For example, if you are used to washing a specific number of clothes per day, you may need fewer cycles as your washing machines can only handle larger loads. 3. Determine the number of loads per machine. Since washing machines cannot handle unsafe loads, it's crucial to select an appropriate machine for the job. For example, if you are washing the same number of clothes every day and need different speeds during the operation, you may need more cycles to reach 200 pounds per day. 4.

Since there is a negative number in this equation, it means that after 13 full days, Jane will have arranged 22 vases and no longer needs to arrange any more. Therefore, the answer to the crucial question (how many vases Jane will arrange on the last day) is 8: Jane will arrange 8 vases of flowers on the last day. Another way to check our answer is to add up the number of works she has already arranged (248 and 154) and then subtract that from the total time it takes to arrange all of the vases (248). 248 - 2288 = X (where X represents the number of vases Jane will arrange on the last day) Simplifying this equation gives us a total of: 248 - X -389 = X When we add up Number of vases Jane has arranged so far (162), the result confirms that Jane will complete the task before having to arrange all of the remaining vases on the last day. Therefore, Jane will decorate the last day's vases with 248 vases arranged (16 X16 =) and then decorate the remaining 324 vases with X (EX = 490). EX - 490 = 323.

First, we need to find the maximum number of large barrels a company can use with 300 tons of oil. However, using only large barrels might cause some barrels to be less than full. To determine how many large barrels are needed, we simply divide the total number of buckets by the maximum number of large barrels: 300 / 6 = 5 with a remainder of 4. correctly  This means the company could only use 5 large barrels, with 4 tons of oil remaining that can be stored in small barrels with the additional benefit of an extra barrel. Therefore, to maximize the number of large barrels used while ensuring every barrel is fully occupied, we multiply the number of large barrels consumed by the maximum capacity of one huge barrel: 5 x 6 = 30 Now, we continue this process of optimizing the number of large barrels used with the remaining amount of oil: 1 large barrel * 5 tons = 95 tons So, to determine how many small barrels are needed to store 60 tons of oil and use them in the least number of cases, we multiply the number of large barrels used by the additional capacity of 1 small barrel to 60 x 5 = 90 times: 70 x 2 = 90 This tells us to use at least 9 large barrels and 5 small barrels. Finally, this gives us the remaining amount of oil that can be stored in small barrels. Therefore the number of small barrels needed to fit the remaining 5 tons of oil is 5.

There are several ways to approach this problem, but 1 possible method is to use fractional barrels. If each barrel can hold 6 tons of oil, the overall capacity of the barrel can be calculated as: - The number of large barrels = 2 x 6 + 1 (6 tons) - The capacity of each single barrel is the same: - Two tons (3 tons x 6 tons) + 1 (7 tons) + 2 (15 tons) Since we want these barrels to use the minimum number of barrels, we will select the largest number between these maximum container capacities that utilizes the least number of barrels. Thus in the case of 1 small barrel, it is preferred to use 1 large barrel. The maximum number of large barrels needed is calculated as: - 6 large barrels * (3 tons + 1) * (1 ton * 2) = 15 large barrels This tells us that we are able to hold a maximum of 15 large barrels at once. However, using just 1 small barrel would completely fill the entire 95 tons of oil and would take too many barrels to completely fill it completely. Therefore, using only 1 small barrel would enable us to minimize the number of barrels needed and maintain overall capacity of the trunk while handling the 95 tons of oil. The final result would appear as: Total capacity of the transport company = 95 tons (or 95/5)  1 large barrel * full capacity = 5 tons - Remains after 6 small barrels = 6 tons of oil Total capacity - (5 ton + 1 large barrels consumed) = 15 tons Remains after 13 barrels (used) = 10 tons (no further oil/flood may spill) Total number of barrels needed = 5 tons (total capacity - Remains after 6 large barrels used) Total number of empty barrels: - 9 small barrels, 2 tons of oil - 12 tons of oil Total number of spare barrels needed - Total number of clean barrels needed Substituting all mentioned values into the form of fractions(holding capacity only satisfies requirement/all factors=1) + sum all together =95 total \u2013 [remains after (6 * 1) + sum\" \u2013 Remains after 3 barrels filledRemains after",

Another way to solve for optimal number of barrels required is to find the factors of 2: 1 big barrel will hold 6 tons of oil - if 2 large barrels were used, they are equal, meaning 2 large barrels would not be enough. Adding to the unknown number of available small barrels, we know that 3 small barrels can make maximum use of the available tanks, and 1 large barrel can store more than 4 tons of oil.

Number of 1-yard pieces: - 5 We cannot cut up any greater than or equal to 1, so we will use our quotient of 2 to get the answer as we did not reach the least number of one-yard pieces. So, - when you cut the 1-yard pieces first, you will produce 2 long pieces (4 yards each) leaving you with a partially cut 1-yard section. - When we cut the 1-yard pieces, there will be only 3 leftover materials in either 4 or 1-yard pieces. So choosing this third option allows us to fit only 1 longer piece (i.e. the one that we cut after cutting 4 yard pieces), resulting in 4 pieces remaining.

In order to minimize the number of pieces, he should cut as many 4-yard pieces as possible before cutting any 1-yard pieces.

So, as follows: - Cutting 3 long pieces would allow the worker to cut 3 steps per step (i.e., not cut the entire rope in half), while cutting 2 small pieces (3 yards  1 yard per piece = 2).

An alternative method to approach this problem is to use proportional reasoning: we can say that the number of students should \"take as many portfolios as possible\", as opposed to having the same number of portfolios for each student.

To work out the total number of truck required, you divide the total weight by the maximum capacity of each truck then determine how many trucks are needed to carry this amount. However, since you can't use a partial truck, you round up to the nearest whole number, which means you need at least 4 large trucks to carry 134 tons of fruits. Since each small truck will only carry 7 tons, you should use 1 small truck to carry 7 tons while at the same time using all large trucks.

If 1 of the large rooms is not completely occupied, then we can try renting an extra large room. If 1 of the facilities available is not enough, then we can always rent a separate room for the 2 people. 5.

One factor that could not be included in 23 (the maximum number of complete groups of up to 26) is the age of the group (26). Therefore, we need to consider how many complete groups of 6 can be made from 26 adults. When we divide 27 by 3, we get 1.6: 26  3 = 8 with a remainder of 1. This means that 8 adults can be fully occupied, but our room rentals would be partial, since we only have 2 people left over. Therefore, to rent the least number of rooms and each room be fully occupied, we should rent 1 small room and add another 1 to the 6 large rooms to fill up the remaining 2 people. It's important to verify that this solution is possible since the number of small rooms should be a factor of both the total number of rooms and the number of large rooms rented. When dealing with a small room, it's crucial to rent an appropriate number of \"extras\" in order to accommodate everyone and rent the least number of rooms.

We want to solve for D and then multiply that by K: 8 * K = 200 g 4. We are given the weight of one jade and the weight of 4s, and we want to find how much heavier a jade is relative to one diamond than the other. Solving for K, we simply take 1*K=5 and divide 2*K=10. 4. We then take the weight distribution of both, dividing K by 4 in which we can calculate the weight capacity of each jade. We can find it: K/4, K/2, K-6, T/K= 140(diameters after reduction=100 grams and the corresponding weight of one jade) 5. Solving for K, we get: K/15 = 20 g 6. Now let dividing both sides by 5 to solve for K: D/K = 50/100 = 0.75 kg, or 1 kg We determine, therefore, that the weight of one jade is 30 grams. 5. To calculate the difference between a jade and a diamond, we would subtract K (20.5 grams) from K (22.5 grams), and add 5 (15 grams) to K (47.5 grams), and get again: K/2 = 30/2 = 5.75 kilometers.

And the total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs, in sum, is 65 kg, and therefore, G (Gross Weight) of 3 (foxes) and 5 dogs = 65 kg (this weight is valid but not expressed as kg).

Since the quotient (0) must be a factor of 2 and 3, the only factor that is common in both numbers is 3 (since it appears in all 3 numbers). Answer: You cannot plant any more sunflowers than you found using the highest common factor. Step 3: Find neighboring factors for each number to determine how many plant rows you can make in each row. Since a common factor is 3 (2 times 3, it is 45) and a common factor is 3, another common factor that is 3 is 5, then 3 is 3. Step 4: Divide their common factors into one of their largest numbers. In this case, each common factor is 3 so you can plant 3 rows of 5 sunflowers, 2 rows of 15 corn, and 2 rows of 3 tomato plants. Answer: The greatest common factor is 3.",

        "chain": "To find the greatest number of plants that can be put in each row, we first need to find the common factor (GCF) of 45, 81 and 63. One common factor is 3. This means that any number that is greater than 3, such as 9, 14, 21, 23, or 45 is the largest number that is a factor of 3 and has fewer than 3 in common. To find the GCF, we take the least common factor (LCF) of 3, 45 and 63 and multiply them together: LCF = 3, 35, 45 And, there we have it, the GCF of 45, 81 and 63 is 15. So, planting 45 sunflowers, 81 corn plants, and 63 tomato plants in each row will have a total of 15 plants. To check that we did the division correctly, we can divide the total number of plants (35) by the GCF of the 3 numbers, starting with 45 (65) and subtracting 51 (31) to get 81. This shows that 81 plant rows can be divided equally among 5 rows (2 x 45 = 81 rows), with 25 plants remaining: Therefore, spacing needs to be ensured that the planting rows are lined up properly.",

        "chain": "To determine when a full moon occurs on a Friday, we first need to find the smallest multiple that 60 days could occur without exceeding past totals of 30 days. The multiples of 60 days that exist are: 30, 60, 30, 60,... Our first multiple that 60 days could cover is 30 days (15 days), 60 days (20 days), or 70 days (3 weeks). We can confidently say that 60 days from now will not occur before another full moon occurs. Since the days must pass before the full moon happens again (which is the common multiple), we can confidently say it will occur before a Friday since such a common multiple exists. Based on the information given, this solution may work because the length of days waiting before a full moon occurs is an inverse (or anti-clockwise) division of the total days. Using this simple equation to find the nearest multiple of 60 days that passes before a full moon occurs, we could use simple arithmetic: - Distance traveled by walk-in = total & distance traveled* - Number of time taken to travel by walk=5 miles - Number of hours traveled by walk=30, 45, 60,... Therefore, we could conclude that 60 days must pass before the full moon occurs again on Friday if the time difference is 55. A simpler way to approach this problem is to make sure that the smallest multiple that 60 days can cover just before a full moon occurs is the sum of all the remaining days of the current week-starting pattern assuming it is a multiple of 30. Putting this information into context, this could look like this: - The length of the previous week's timetables varies depending on how many days the week passes, so we can find this more consistently by adding 45 minutes to an existing timetable instead of taking a new distance for them. - The total number of occurrences, such as weekends and winter solstice days, usually works best when the solstice time overlaps with the workweek. However, weekends are days where workweek starts before the full moon occurs, so this calculation won't work as efficiently. Therefore, it would be more efficient to use the fact that it equates with the previous weeks timetable.",

        "chain": "Let's start by assigning variables to represent the unknown values. Let \"x\" represent the number of marbles Mark gave to Evan. So when we set up the problem, the equation: 24 + x = 2 + x We want to solve for \"x\", so we don't need another equation. Let's isolate x with \"x\". Let's take x = 9 and then divide both sides by 22: 2 = x 24  2 = 7 x = 6 So Mark gave Evan 6 marbles, but he already had 6 marbles. Evan now has 3 + 6 = 9 marbles. So he has to receive at least 9 marbles from Mark. To find how many marbles Mark gave Evan, we need to find the value of \"x\". One way to do this is by subtracting Evan's amount from the value of Mark's, which is 24: 3 - 9 = 4.67... This tells us that before Mark gave 6 marbles, Evan had 48 marbles. And after Mark gave away those 36 marbles, he almost had 48 marbles. However, that calculation was wrong because Evan already had 3 marbles, so they couldn't have been split equally. So let's try again: 24 + 6 = 36. And 48 \u2013 2 = 18.25... \u2013 16 \u2013 So we know that Mark gave Evan 16 marbles, but it wasn't the exact number he originally had. We couldn't actually solve for the value of \"x\" since there wasn't any other variable we could use to set up an equation for x. Instead, we get the same answer - that Mark gave Evan 6 marbles, but unfortunately we don't know what that was.",

This gives you the total number of children that were spoken to by the respective guides. To isolate the variable, you can subtract this number from the total number of guides. Therefore: 44 - 19 - 25 = -6. So the 22 guides spoke to a total of -6 children, which is not a whole number. However, the way we approach this problem is in two parts. One part is to see how many children each guide spoke to, then we can use variable 1 to calculate the total number of children spoke to. Let n be the number of girls or boys talked to by the two guides combined. Since we have 22 guides, in addition to the original total number (24) we also have: Total number of children talked to = 22 * n Simplifying this equation as follows: 32 - n = 0 So 32 children were spoken to by only one guide. To break it down further, you can set up an equation to solve for n (since both sides of the equation will equal in some number), then: n equation = 22 * n // 12 + n = 20 That represents the total number of children spoken to by both guides. Now we could solve for n by multiplying both sides by 2: n = 44 + n/2 = 51 n gives us 53. Essentially, zoo guides spoke to 51 children.",

        "chain": "To solve this problem, we don't have enough information to determine the total number of children being spoken to by both guides. Let's assume that each guide spoke to the same number of children. For example, if we let \"x\" be the total number of children that were spoken to, then the two guides 'x' and 'y' should equal each other. Therefore: 19 + 25 = (x+y) Simplifying the equation: 2x + 25 = 3x We also know that the number of guides is 22, so: 22 (total guides) + 3x = 32 However, the problem doesn't state specifically that this is in \"one\" group, so we can't say clearly whether or not the numbers mentioned here add up. And again: (2x+15) + (3x+5) = 40 This tells us that there are a total of 34 children, and our guides spoke to exactly the same number of children. However, we don't know how many more guides there are than these two groups (since we don't have information about them or the numbers we're given) so we can't be sure that the total number we chose is the same. Regarding rounding errors: We might have assumed that the larger number of children (28-34 instead of 22) was spoken to by just one guide (let's assume it was two) and the smaller group (29-4), but then we found that the other one was spoken to four kids (i.e. the one we assumed). Therefore: (19 + 25) + 1 (22 - 4) + 1 = 44 Either way, we have inferred that the total number of children was in \"one group\" and we know the smaller group was in \"two groups\". Therefore: x+y = (25 + 19) - y = (22-4) There's a good place to explain this because it shows there aren't any unequal or hidden numbers so we know we'll get there.

Another way to approach this problem is to count the total number of pictures in Ralph's photo album and then subtract the number of pictures Derrick has from that total: 26 + 34 = 81 Since Ralph has so many pictures, and Derrick has 34 so many more, we know that fewer is a better answer than inaccuracy.

        "chain": "Martin sells a total of 48 + 28 = 76 hamburgers after 6 o'clock. To determine how many hamburgers Martin sells on average per shift, we can divide his total hamburgers sold per week ($6) by the number of hours he works per shift ($24). Therefore, Martin sells about 22 / 24 = 2.67 hamburgers per shift. Now, since we know that Martin works each day (24 hours a week), we can look for clues about how many hamburgers Martin sells by actually dividing by the number of hours he works per shift. If we assume that Martin sells the same number of hamburgers before and after 6 o'clock every week, then according to some formula he sells for a certain number of hamburgers within the 24-hour cycle. Let's use something along the lines of \"x\" to represent the hamburgers sold per shift. x2 = 76 x3 = 54 So Martin sells 54 hamburgers during his shift. Finally, we can use some simple addition to get the amount Martin sells each day since hamburgers are sold in whole numbers. By doing this, we find that on an average week, Martin sells a little more than what he did before during the day. To calculate how many hamburgers he sells each week, you subtract these 3 total hamburgers from the average number: x3 + (48 - 76) = 22 And we think about that this puts us at a little over 2 apiece since the part of the equation that says something about division and addition in a common system. So we can ajoin the math with: x3 + x = (48 \u2013 54) = 3 x7 = 6 + 6... Then, we see that after 9: - x = 4 - Let's try: x = 4 - 2 = 1 -- --- 6=12 In summary, Martin sells about 76 hamburgers after 6 o'clock every week based on a pattern at the Hungry Hippo.",

Therefore, he sells 246 + 2.46 = 76 hamburgers after 6 o'clock. Again, using the formula above for the hamburger sales, we can solve per day for hamburger sales. We can divide the total hamburger sales by the number of hours, and then multiply by the hamburger sales for the different amounts sold per day: 76 hamburger sales  24 hours/day = 12.57 hamburgers per day This equals to 9.23 hamburgers/day, which is close to the actual number sold.

Since they hiked 9 miles on the first day, this means they have 36 - 9 = 29 miles left to hike. Therefore, they have 29 miles left to hike. To check that our system of measurement reflects reality, we can go a step further by discovering whether some of our numbers (i.e. Charlotte's backpack or Tripp's backpack) make an overall difference in weight between them - specifically, how much of their respective weights weigh relative to each other? These numbers could be contributing to any possible problems they might encounter throughout the hike. Overall, if we consider only Tripp and Charlotte's weight in comparison to Tripp's relative weight per mile, we get the total overall weight distribution across their hiking route.

However, to answer the question conceptually, we can suggest that she would need a total of 35 stickers to achieve the goal. In other words, she needs to earn at least 31 stickers to reach this goal. Taking this approach, we can think about two possible scenarios: 1) If she earns fewer stickers from her hard work and provides better service to customers, and 2) If she has received more stickers from her helped colleagues and continues to earn more stickers, her total amount could increase accordingly.

Another way to approach this problem is to think of it in terms of starting with an unknown number of bottle caps and working your way up to the next one. To start with, you work your way up from 1 to 2 until you find the next one. This could represent how many bottle caps Danny has in his collection so far. When you reach the end of the range (i.e. 55), you should take out the ones that were found at the park, which is the ones that are added to the collection every day. You can do this by having the highest value in a bucket (e.g. 5, 6, 21, 24, etc), subtracting this from the previous number (e.g. 55). Finally, you add the ones that were found at the park to the existing counts to see if you reach a common number. You can represent this using simple arithmetic. You add the resulting value \"x\" to the starting value and move on to the next common value. This will show you your totals in pounds (assuming you want to calculate how many hours of operation it took to find the x bottle caps, and then adding the new numbers.)

You cannot buy 15 packs of tulips, since there is no such thing as a fraction of a pack. - When Rita chooses the correct number of bulbs from the pack based on this criterion, we are faced with a mathematical process: mathematicians of equivalent proportion. - Let T be the number of packs of tulip, and C = the number of packs of daffodil. We are formula 1(C) where: C = (c) We wanted to find the smallest value for a parameter that governs the number of \"packs of tulip\" according to these premises: 1.

One possible method to do this is to factor the product of the 2 numbers together: 10 = 5 * 1 15 = 5 * 1 The common factor they have in common is 5, so either method will work for this design. To see how many kits Lexi can make, we multiply their greatest common factor that is 5 with each other: 5 * 1 = 5 * 2 5 * 1 = 5 This tells us that we can make 5 kits with each set of 5 cans of soup and 5 sets of 5 boxes of tissues.

One way to make this solution simpler is to find the factors of the two numbers and look for one that can modulate them. One common factor is 60 (20 x 12 = 60) and 60/2 = 15, so choosing the largest of those numbers results in an individual pens having 60/20 or 60 pencils each (12).

If someone is arriving at a table, they should be seated next to the same group. However, since a table couldn't have a mix of ages, we can only require the most common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 20. So for example, if there are 2 adults (a couple), it would be appropriate to divide the adults and kids into equal groups in either 3 or 4. Next, we choose how many groups we want, because we want each table to have the same groups. Let's assume there are 2 adults and 4 children. If there are 3 adults, we can split them into groups of 3 adults each (totaling 3 adults). The 4 adults remain, while 3 remains because we need a mixed number of people. So we move left to get to a larger group. There exists no great need for \"tables\". But if there are 5 people at the table, then we could fit everyone onto one table for the same duration. In this case, the greatest number of identical tables would be 5 groups of 3 adults and 15 if we adhere to the LCM method. Since the goal was to divide the participants as evenly as possible and put everybody at a table quickly, we found the smallest number closest to solving the problem without having to worry about any leftover people or units. Finding greatest number of tables by checking every result combines quickly by analyzing every step until we land on a common one. For now, let's try both methods: 1. Start by finding a prime factor that divides both 12 and 20 evenly: Then, we need an odd integer, such as 2, that matches a integer number quotient of our factorization process. 2. Check that the numbers we choose add up exactly: 12 + 20 make up exactly one-third of the total quotient. Performing addition: Both 12 + 20 make identical numbers, whereas the other factor that divides both numbers differently. The common factor of 12, 20, and 12 is 2 so that 3 and 1/2 are divisible by 2, while 2/5 and 1/3 are not. 3.

Therefore, the GCF of 12 and 20 is 4, since it is a common factor and therefore the largest of them. To create tables with identical groups of friends, they need to divide the participants into groups of 6, as they cannot seat two groups of 6. However, they also have eight people left over who cannot be divided equally among the tables. To address this, they could decide to split the adults and children into equal, equal groups. In this case, they could seat 6 adults and 8 children per table, which would be an alternative option since each table cannot seat more than six people per group. Either approach will enable the party planner to create identical, identical tables with the same group of people, each table having the same number of adults (18 + 8), with no people left over.",

        "chain": "To figure out how many boxes of each type of soap the shop would have sold, we need to take their first number of bars of soap (which is 5 bars) and their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM is a prime number, so we can list them along: - 5 bars - 19 bottles - least common multiple = 5 bar - 9 bottles This demonstrates that the shop must have sold 19 boxes before they sold 8 bars since he cannot have a multiple of 5. The first possible box of 5 bars might be 1, 2, 3, or 5, since this will ensure that each box carries at least one bar. We can use the LCM of these numbers to determine the number of boxes selling identical numbers including bars and bottles. The LCM will be: - Number of 2 soap boxes (5 bars) - Number of 19 bottles sold (1 bottle) We always find the LCM at the top of the list, so this should make sense because we need the same product! First, let's look at some multiples of both 5 and 19, and start analyzing what makes them unique. 5 : 5, 10, 15, 25, 30, 35... 19: 19, 34... So we know that 5 bars are unique because they fit neatly into a 19 boxes of 5 bars each. We can figure out how many 5 bars are needed to fill them all the way (five bars for each of the 19 boxes), and multiply the remaining 5 bars by 5 to get the number we need for all boxes (5 bars). This gives us: - Number of boxes with 5 bars each = 5 boxes - Number of boxes with 19 bottles each = 19 boxes So, the shop sold 19 boxes of 5 bars each. We already found this by looking at their LCM for this number.",

        "chain": "We have to figure out ways to best solve this problem while maintaining a consistent sequence of numbers. To do this, we need to find a common number for each type of product sold. To set up some rules, let x=l string for any quantity we would like to consider. Specifically, let x be any multiple of an integer variable (specifically, the prime factorization of x)? Let our least common multiple (LCM) of 5 be any even number or multiple of 5. As we did before, the multiples of 5 should be a multiple of both 5, 15, and 45, plus we had an integer (target number) of 17 that satisfies both 5, 19. So we have a multiple of 5 that is also a multiple of 19. Let's assume for simplicity we want the LCM of 5 and 19, respectively. As we found earlier, LCM is only the smaller of 5 and 19, so x = 5 + 19 - specifically the value where LCM is obtained by taking the smallest positive integer that is equal to 2 whole numbers. We want x to be a multiple of both 5 and 19, so we should try finding a value of LCM that maximizes both l and 2 that will satisfy it. If we start using only 1 variable for both boxes widths we'll see how many things go wrong for an given box width. We need to consider factors that affect both widths from 0 to 45. Prime factorizing at most just 5 tries to force only res ips compared to 5s on all our values if 1 or both no variable in certain dimensions can push other values into LCM. One approach is to find the LCM in our formulas and make the least common multiple out of 1. Starting from 1 factor and multiplying each of its sides: Factors are just numbers being evenly spaced. This leads us to find 1 value: Factors 0: None of the number 0 there exists (repeat value as -1) If we make several more than 5 box widths, combining them we see that LCM is one solution or 1 value even with all 3 of these. Plugging in LCM for all range of integers, we reach a common multiple: |-1| = 5 **1**(5 x 1)| = 20  1** _ 5 -> 5 So let'",

Another way to think about this is to use addition. If you subtract Frankie's candy amount from Max's candy amount, the difference is represented by \"x.\" The addition problem provides two different methods to approach the problem: 1. Since Frankie received 74 pieces of candy, subtract thisfrom Max's candy amount: 92 pieces of candy - 74 pieces of candy = 18 better pieces of candy 2. This equation takes into account that Max may have received more candy than Frankie based on factors other than money (money owed to candy account) 3. This solution doesn't work because Max's candy amount is so close to Frankie's rate (74 - 92) and it only accounts for fractions (i.e. 3.4), so there is no clear difference between them. Either way, subtracting 31 from both sides of the equation yields 20 more pieces of candy than either could realistically handle (74-11=10). Either way, we get 19.",

We know that the science kits were sold, so the question can be written as: 45 science kits - 9 = 36 puzzles Now we need to solve for \"x\". We know that the question asks for the number of puzzles, so we can set the equation above equal to or greater than the number of science kits: 39 = x - 9 To solve for 'x,' we can subtract 9 from both sides of the equation: 39 = 45 - 9 Simplifying the equation: 39 = 42 So the Smart Mart sold 42 puzzles last week.

For example: - If we know Erin rode 73 miles in total, we could represent that as a distance of 73 miles on the second day. However, this answer doesn't give us much information in terms of how many laps they rode on both days. In reality, we'd be better off assuming they rode exactly 73 miles, knowing they didn't ride any additional mileage on the second day.

For example, in June, the store increased the number of hammers by one frame from June to July. Similarly, in July, the store increased the number of hammers by one frame from July to August. In this case, the increment was one frame. Either way, the linear formula yields: num = increase * (number of subsequent increments) num % (increase) = (number of subsequent increments) Using subtraction: In sum, from June to July, each increment increased by one frame (i.e., hammer length) vs. previous increment (number of subsequent increments).

        "chain": "There are different ways to approach this problem, but 1 way is to write each page as \"x\" (since we know that Karlene reads 12 pages each day). Today, we are reading 3 pages, so we can use this approach to figure out the pattern. We can see that Karlene is trying to keep working even though she is behind (or past) her usual timetables. Pages read on Tuesday: 3 x Tuesday = 6 pages (she finished with 4 pages by the end of Tuesday) Pages read on Wednesday: 6 x Wednesday = 12 pages (finished with 4 pages by the end of Wednesday) Pages read on Thursday: 24 x Monday = 24 pages (finished with 4 pages by the end of Thursday) Pages read on Saturday: 48 x (number of pages she has read while so far) pages Read on Sunday: x x Where \"x\" represents \"number of pages she plans to read on Sunday\" This confirms that Karlene is predicted to read more pages on Sunday. Another way to determine the number of pages she can read on Sunday is to keep pace with what she read on previous days (assuming she stays the same) and make sure that she sticks to the same pattern of increasing by 12 (pages). Using this pattern, we can figure out what page she should read on Sunday based off what she did on the previous day (assuming she sticks to the same pattern). Page read on Sunday: x x Sunday = total page completed on Tuesday + (1 page-per-page) pages  2.89 pages = pages read on Saturday But we haven't had much success translating our previous pattern into numerical values. So we know that the average number of pages read per day so far is 2 pages. Thus, this also shows that Karlene is reading an average number of pages per morning, consistently approaching the previous number of pages and creating new reading habits. Therefore, the calculated pages read on Sunday will depend on the actual availability and volume of books she has in her collection and reading distance (i.e., how many books she has read and when she can fit that in versus past readings, especially if she finishes a certain number of pages earlier than those expected).",

Let's say for example, for Monday, she is planning to read \"12 pages\", which would be equivalent to: 3 x Sunday = (6 x 4 = 24) So assuming she will read 12 pages on average, Karlene should do the same for Sunday. We also predict that she will be reading an average of 48 pages on average (which is 4 pages per day), especially considering there are 12 fewer pages than previous days such as Saturday. We can use the next pattern to get this right: 4 (pages per day) = 72 pages (increase of 42 pages per day) We can verify that this pattern holds true for Saturday, as we see that when she read 48 pages on Saturday, Karlene finished the pattern by reading four more pages than on Saturday.

However, if Kristen specifically asked for \"minimum' coins, the first option would be 1.36.

Let's say Kira has X number of quarters and Y number of dimes. Then, she wants to use as few coins as possible to make the total minimum. Since quarters are worth 25 cents and dimes are worth 10 cents, we can set up the equation: 25/2 = 20/2 (minimizing the number of coins will result in 2) Next, we want to choose the smallest and most common, which is 6 (since we first chose the smallest coin). Thus we can choose 6: 6/25 = 26 This means that Kira would use 6 quarters and 6 dimes, for a total of 15 coins. Notice that Y must be divisible by 2, so only 6/5 of a coin can actually be divided using half of a coin: 1 whole coin (1 quarter x 6 coins = 5 per set of 5), and 2 partial coins (1 quarter x 2 coins = 4 per set of 4 coins). So we are left with (6*5/2 = 16) only 8 coins because 12/3 = 5. To eliminate those extra unused coins, we know that 6 quarters would make X and 5/5 = Y total larger and would create unneeded coins. So Kira\u2019s optimum solution would be 18/5 = 8.

Prime factorsize all numbers The factors of 2 numbers are 2 twice their sum, 3 and 5. 2. Combine them When forming a multiplication problem, use all the power of each symbol to give a quotient with as many odd numbers as possible. The problem tells us the possible numbers which would involve using as many coins as possible while working with the least amount of money. If possible, we want a quotient when applying the qrt(10) when making the multiplication part, because 1/3 of the coins will be multiplication facts and 1/30 are odd factors (a common practice when doing these types of multiplication). Since 1/3 only works since quarters are easier to work with than dimes. Fortunately, Kira still pays attention to maximizing coin counts. We know that quarters make up about half the total money available, and the remainder shows what coins that makes up does get into our quotient. Assuming all the coins multiply to 2, we need a factor of 5 with 5 equal to 7. That means that 7, which is the most efficient method to find the smallest possible combination after getting the quarters and dimes together. It seems to work. Therefore we divide the multiplication result by the value of each coin 5 times 7 gives us 9. As expected, a quotient of this multiplication coefficient is 10, and there are 5 equal combinations of tens (also expressed as 9). So, as per the problem, Kira has 9 coins, made up by substituting every possible combination numistor (2, 5, 9, 12, 15, 18).

        "chain": "To solve the problem, we need to know how many L are in 1 L. Let x be the amount of soup Thomas froze. According to the problem, Thomas packed 1.6 L of soup in his kids' lunches. So, 1.6 L amounted to 16 L (4700 mL - 1.6 L), which equals 8700 mL. Next, we know that he made 8700 mL of soup. So the amount of soup that he froze is 8700 mL - (2.67 L) = 4700 mL. Now, we want to find out how much Mg represents in grams because he is asked to convert grams to units. Substituting this value back into the original equation: 8.7 L => L = 3550 mL If we subtract the 1.6 L that Thomas packed in the lunches from the total amount of soup he made: 8700 mL - 3550 mL = 7100 mL Therefore, we can deduct 7100 mL from the amount of soup he froze: 3700 mL  2 = 3550 mL - 6900 mL Since you cannot deduct 700 mL from a volume, we need to solve for -C: C = 36700 mL - 38700 mL This is the value of C that Thomas could have used for frozing as the fraction for calculating the fraction. In summary, there are 6.4 L and 0.3 L in 0.3 L. It is important to remember that converting to grams in this case when multiplying with other units (since 300 mL is not divided into 60 in 0.4 L).",

Wes filled the rest of the space in 1/4 to make fruit punch. 3/4 of 1/4 is 0.25 liters (we cannot have 0.25 ounces of a liquid). 1/4 of 1/4 = 0.15 liters So the full volume of fruit punch was 0.15 liters.

Alternatively, we can write the proportion as a function with variables: x = Steven's fraction (1/18) + x = Steven's proportion (7/20) = 18/7 = 13.5 The proportion is still a function, meaning that the sum of Steven's and Megan's marbles equals 33, but in this case we are finding how many marbles she received: 24 + x = (33/24)/2 = 18.75 So in this fraction form, when the ratio of their marbles is 3:4. Then we can solve for x either by cross-multiplying: 3*18 = 748 945 x = 948 So the fraction representing Steven's marbles is indeed 19.832 which rounds down to 17.981.",

Thus the amount of compost in the barrel can be expressed as: 4200 g % (1/4) = 4200 g To convert grams to kilograms: 1000 = 1 kg Therefore, there is 1 kg of compost in the barrel.

According to the problem, the remaining space in the barrel was the one-fourth of the barrel, so we can set up the equation: 1/4 * 1 = 4200/x Where \"x\" represents the weight of a certain amount of compost.

In this pattern, Jenna is adding 112 beads to each new jar, making sure that the beads are increasing by 112 every time. Another way to approach this problem is to use algebra. Let's let x be the number of beads Jenna will put in the fifth jar. If we look at Jenna's pattern in adding new beads into boxes, we get: - Then (number of beads added to each new jar) = (75+46minus 1) - Then (number of beads Jenna has already put in the fourth jar) = (92+91minus 1) If we look at Jenna's pattern in adding new beads into boxes, we get: - Putting in 112 beads satisfies the original pattern of adding beads into new jars. Then (number of beads Jenna has already put) = 101 + 56 ----- (number of beads Jenna will put in fourth jar) - Now we want to solve for x. Plugging in 112 for num in the first jar gives us: - Total number of beads = 74 + (45-6) - Number of beads in the second jar = (83+46minus 1) - Number of beads in the fifth jar = 101 + 65 = 110 Therefore, Jenna will put 112 beads in the fifth jar if this pattern continues.",

To determine how many identical platters can be prepared, we need to determine the maximum number of slices of each type of pizza that can be placed on a single platter. For the cheese pizza, which can be cut into 6 slices, we have: 6 slices: 3 pizza slices (2 - 3 pizza slices) For the veggie pizza, which can be cut into 12 slices (2 - 12 slices) To use the maximum number of slices of any pizza in a platter, we need to divide both pizzas by the GCF. 6 slices per pizza / GCF of 6 and 12 slices = 1 platter per group for cheese pizza (/6 slices per cheese pizza).

This means that we can cut both pizzas into equally-sized groups of 6 slices, and for each group, we can divide them into slices approximately 3.25 times (2 slices per group for cheese). We can then divide their totals into 6 slices (2 x 3 = 12). If we split 6 slices into each group, each group would receive either a 6 or 1 slice, meaning we wouldn't be able to evenly divide 6 slices into groups of 6. We can use the GCF to isolate the optimal number of identical platters. If we divide our pizzas into 6 slices per group, we can make 2 identical platters, as follows: 2 x 3 = 6 8 x 3 = 12 Each platter would contain 1 cheese slice and 2 veggie slices. Since we divided the pizzas into 6 slices each, each with exactly 2 slices per group (6 slices total), and with the remaining items (we can't divide them into 1 slicing each, we need the full 4 slices available for both pizzas to form).

To decorate papers with the same combination of stickers and no stickers left over, we need to find the highest power of each sticker that appears in both lists. One approach is to note that we take away the common factors (3 x 3 and 3) and list them into the prime factor numbers that we need. Specifically, we take away 3 and 5, which means we can only include up to 3 stickers in either 1 or both of those numbers, therefore leaving us with an unequal number of stickers in each number: So instead of choosing 3*5=3 to represent the number of identical papers Tess can decorate, we choose 3 that have already been used before using the LCM (Least Common Multiple of 3**2. This is:) Hence we combine 3 and 5, taking away any common factors they could conflict with to eliminate the maximum stickers our cards could possibly have in common: 3*(3)(3)-3*5 = 27 So using these 3 leftover stickers from the previous page demonstrates that Tess can decorate papers just using 3 and 5 with no stickers leftover To decorate 45 identical papers we would use 3*5+3*5 =65 heart stickers (3 * 5) Using those 3 stickers and 3*5+21 canvases in place of 5*10=45 stars stickers (x-1) and 5*15=27 stars sticks (yet-1) using the LCM again) This confirms our previous answer of equal number as follows:] Start coloring pages making use of 5 stickers per page (since combining 2 hearts with 6 stars results in using both :)] |-- \"45 I used to dress this pretty paper; 27... you know.\" -------",

We can start by figuring out how many arrangements of '+2+3' can be made using all 45 heart and 27 star stickers available. 45 hearts + 27star cards equals 45 with a remainder of 3 which means we can only make 45 - 3 * 5 = 25 papers with heart stickers while using all 27star cards (45  35 = 4) which means we have 1 left over. Therefore, when we decorate 5 whole papers with 45 heart stickers (equation 45c1, 45c2) and 4 papers with 27 star stickers (equation 27c1, 273) we will have 3 leftover stickers. By having the same number of hearts and stars on each paper, we maximize the flexibility of our decorations and reduce leftover stickers. Therefore, our goal is 35 identical papers using all 45 heart and 27 star stickers, all using the smallest number of stickers possible. An example of making each page identical is 15 - 5 = 15 papers with 45 hearts and 55 stars arranged similarly. This shows that we can decorate 3 complete papers, each containing at least one heart sticker, but we still need to use some 21st-century idea of finding prime variables underlying such combinations to achieve maximal uniformity.

Therefore, the greatest common factor of 45 and 27 is 9. To decorate papers which have similar combinations of stickers, Tess should determine which stickers is assigned to each page and how many stickers remain. Looking towards the right, we choose the number of heart stickers that corresponds to its maximum size and allocate them correctly. In this case, if the number of heart stickers is less than 7, the GCF of 45 and 27 is 9. This means that the maximum possible pair of stickers Tess can arrange in this manner is 7, since the small number is enough to achieve the whole number requirement. There are also some constraints on how many times the stickers or number of combinations are allowed without a remainder. For example: There are no restrictions on how many stickers can be put on a single page, or there can be some constraints on the number of stickers used per page if there are multiple ways to decorate it. For example, if we try to use 13 stickers per page (6 heart stickers and 12 star stickers per page, it won\u2019t work since 13 doesn\u2019t go with any combination. To avoid this scenario, there will be a maximum of 13 stickers per page used. Any combination which cannot be divided equally into both 4 equals zero stickers either side. As a last resort, we can resort to a combination of the smaller stickers which maximizes the remaining stickers while maintaining the overall appeal of the paper. For example, we can choose one combination where the main stickers appear twice on a page using as many heart stickers as possible. In this case: The size of the stickers used would determine how many full pages we could decorate. For example, if we use 2 hearts and 1 star as a combination: Overall the number of papers that work well with the given requirements + space condition is as follows: | 45 + 27 | |45 |54| |70",

To do this, we need to find the highest common factor (HCF) of 12 and 28, which is 1. This factor connects all the multiples of 1 to ensure that every basket contains all the necessary items1. To find the highest LCF, we perform a simple list of all the prime factors and look for the greatest common one: 2 x 3 x 7 = 36 This tells us that all 32 of the toys can fit in 1 basket, with the remaining 2 leftover. Now we need to figure out how many of each type \u2014 markers, coloring books, and crayons \u2014 we can buy to organize the remaining 2 sets. Assuming each basket contains exactly 12 animals or sets, then we can only stock up on coloring books (2, 3, 4 or 5) if we want to distribute them equally. If we have 1 set of coloring books (which we can have as another set of 8). All 3 sets of 24 pictures will suffice. Likewise, we have a total of 28 markers which can be divided equally among 3 baskets as each consisting 1 set plus 8 sets of 16 crayons or 2 sets (with some variation)). So in total, we have 34 toys spread into baskets, which were split evenly into 16 sets.

We know that butterflies and fireflies have similar numbers, so we need to see what factor both 44 and 17 have in common to determine their respective values. We can do this by listing the common factors of 44 and 17. 44: 1, 2, 4, 8, 22, 44 17: 1, 3, 11, 22, 27, 37 The smallest number that appears on both lists is 4, which appears in both 44 and 17. Therefore, the smallest number of butterflies Kristen could have seen is 44 butterflies in groups of 44. To check that this is correct, we can see that the least common multiple of 44 and 17 is indeed 444. This means that any multiple of 44 or 17 above 444 is valid. Since we found that 744 is valid, these are the only known values where 744 and 17 both appear as valid numbers. To check if this is correct, let's start by looking at the larger non-negative factor that both 44 and 17 share: 4 44 equals 17 while the smaller factor that both 4 and 17 have is 8. This means that all four factors plus 1 are evenly divisible by 44. So the least common multiple of 44 and 17 between 44 and 17 is indeed 844 \u2013 which means that if we subtract 444 from both sides of the equation, there will always be an odd number there. So the smallest number of butterflies Kristen could have seen is 744 butterflies in groups of 44 and then 747 butterflies in groups of 17 for the smallest possible total count.",

This would mean that the number of fireflies Kristen observes is exactly divisible by the number of butterflies.

The prime factorizations of 44 are: 44 = 2 x 2 x 2 17 = 2 x 2 x 3 The resulting product of these prime factors ensures that the insect population is at maximum while minimizing the number of insects in the environment.

Let's say Steven walks 5 pets per group (with Gabe walking in groups of 2, he'd walk 5 pets per group, and Steven walks in groups of 10). Therefore, G+S = 6/2 = 5 and S = 10/2 = 10/3 S must be a multiple of both 5 and 10, since both must be integers. To find a non-negative value, we substitute it back into G. We could then give it to Steven as 10 pets per group, giving him a total of 20 pets.

What is the smallest number of muffins that the bakery could have sold?\n",
        "chain": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest number that matches both 18 and 5. Let's work backwards: Yesterday afternoon, there were 6 packages of muffins (36 croissants) and 4 packages of cookies (25) where each package contains 18 croissants and 5 cookies. So the total number of croissants sold would have been 6 x 18 divided by 5 being the number of croissants sold. However, since we can't sell a fractional number of croissants, we need to look for the smallest number that could satisfy both conditions. To begin, we could find all possible combinations of 18 and 5 croissants that match 16: Multiples of 18: 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, 108,... Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 75... From this, we can see that the same number of muffins can be sold every day for a multiple of 15 and 45. Therefore, if the person wanted to buy more than 18 packages yesterday afternoon, the smallest number of muffins that they could have sold would just be 18*5=18 and 5*5=25 cupcakes. Answer: The smallest number of muffins the bakery could have sold would be one package of 18 croissants and 2 packages of 5 cookies. To confirm this, let's find the total number of croissants sold: 6 packages of 18 croissants = 108 croissants (5 x 18) 1 package of 5 cookies = 35 croissants (24 croissants sold) There were at least 2 dozen cakes (3 x 5=18), and 125 cookies (4 x 5=70... So the smallest number of muffins that the bakery could have sold is indeed 108 croissants (a multiplier of 17 with a remainder of 45 that rounds back to 24).",

Zack tutors groups of 14, so for a single tutor, we would give him 14 x 14 = 432 values. Karen tutors groups of 10, so for a single tutor, she would give her 10 x 10 = 1001 values. Looking at these two lists, we realize that the number of students they choose is the smallest number they can have together regardless of their differences (i.e. 14, 20, 30, 40...). However, let's work with a prime number first, since this will give us the smallest possible values for the 2 students they choose. So the smallest possible solution is 5400, which is the greatest common factor of both 14 and 10. This means Zack and Karen will have: 14 x 10 = 780 values 10 x 10 = 780 values Both Zack and Karen tutored multiple classes of students, so 780 is their common multiple. However, to find the smaller value, we need to do some careful math. For example, could we get a maximum value for 780 if we only want the total number of students in 8 groups (i.e. 14 for Zack and 10 for Karen) or 780 if we only want the fraction of the group size. For example, what if we only want to calculate total student number per group, we need to work with smaller numbers of groups of 5, which would work without any fluctuations. Alternatively, we could think of the potential values for the remaining number of students if we maximize the maximum capacity of 1 group of 5 and decrease the number of groups by 10. For instance, is there a possibility that 780 is not an integer? In that case, our number of tutors needs a whole number of sets and therefore they would be working with 10 people in groups of 432, then 780 = 14*14, where x represents the total number of groups with (x's) and possible (x's) of 0's. Either way we arrive at the same answer: 5400 = 140/10 = 1080 - 10800 = 1010 The answer depends on what type of students Zack suggests and what type of tutors Karen chooses.",

This means that some of the compartments could be temporarily filled with 5 pieces of luggage, while others were initially filled with the remaining 5 pieces of luggage. The airline cannot have partial compartments, so it is better to have few compartments than none at all. To arrive at this answer, we can use factorial: Factor 1 - Capacity of each compartment (5 pieces of luggage) = Constancy of the whole compartment When we calculate the number of pockets ( compartments) which are not completely full, the factors 1 doesn't involve the question being answered explicitly. So in this case, we simply replace \"x\" with the compartment completely if necessary to get the total capacity: 5 pieces of luggage/compartment = 41 items of luggage No matter what capacity you opt for - it always has room for only one more piece of luggage. Hence, there will always be compartment that isn't full. Another way to verify this solution is by using multiplication. We add the number of compartments that are filled to get the capacity of all compartments combined. Thus, for instance: 4 extra compartments/compartment plus 2 extra compartments/sub compartments which simplifies to 2 extra compartments/sub compartments Adding together: 41 pieces of luggage + 22 extra compartment.., results in: 46 completed compartments This conclusion confirms that the airline has no empty compartments, and therefore, all compartments are full.",

Given the preceding sequence works, using this new value of \"10-12\" as an equation expression: - 1 (number of questions Steve can answer) + 9 (number of questions Steve can't answer) = 35 Since \"10-12\" corresponds to the actual number of questions on Steve's test, we can expect him to answer 35 questions completely.

In either case, subtracting 15 from 15 is a quicker way to determine how many chairs were sold.",

Alternatively, if we wanted to know the specific age of Steven, we could take a look at his age from different angles: 1. Let's take the year 1524 as an example: 1. Since that age is 12 years old, Devon age is 2 more than half that, which looks like this: Devon age = 12 Years old - 2 = 103.5. This verifies that there arose different changes during his childhood since he changed his age from 12, ie. the middle school. 2.

To border each side with satin ribbon, we need to subtract the length of the border from the length of the ribbon needed for each side. Adding the length to each side equals the width and depth of the border, so the length of ribbon required to border each side is:  = 4 cm + 6cm The perimeter of this hexagon, however, is only 4 cm, so its perimeter is indeed 42 cm - 4 cm = 18 cm So any ribbon length beyond 18cm will give us the length of ribbon required for bordering each side.

However, we can't have a fraction of a minute, so let's use 50 as a reference for this problem.

Substituting this value into P = 2, we get: P=2(2 miles/mile) P=3 miles Now let's find the distance Chad must walk. Since the radius of the circle is 2 miles, we know that the walk would be two miles. We can use this information to set up a proportion: K = R2 where K represents the distance across the circle. We can choose to solve this fractional distance or walk for distance, as needed. But we also know that the diameter of the lake, which in this case, is 2 miles. So we can plug this information into the formula: K = (2 miles/mile)/2 K = 3.14 This formula is useful if we want to find the radius of the circle. Now we can subtract the diameter from the radius: K = (2 miles/mile)/2 K = 3.14 We can use this value of K to solve for the radius: K = (5 miles/mile)/2 Since the radius doesn't match with the total diameter of the lake, we don't even know how far to go. We know that K = three miles. So we just calculated: K = (5 miles/hour) - (2 miles/hour) K = 1.14 We can rewrite this as a fraction: K = (5 miles/day)/2 Now we just need to rearrange the formula to find the radius: K = (1 miles/hour)/4 K = 10.74 This is just a trick question. To really simplify the problem, we need to take the value of K down to what a standard fraction look like: K = (9 miles)/20 P = (5 miles/hour) We want to solve for the actual radius, which means that K is simply a fraction of a mile. So we multiply the radius with the number of miles: K = 9 miles So we end up with: K = (10 miles/hour)*10 = 76 Note that this is just a subtraction problem. As we set up the formula above, the actual actual distance on the lake is indeed 76 miles, but since we are trying to find out how short it is to walk, we need to subtract that from the distance instead: K + K = (7 miles/hour",

Therefore we have 8 large pancakes that are 10 inches in diameter, each approximately 2 inches wide (since 10/16 of a pancake is equal to 2.5). But we also know from the problem that the idea of having small pancakes was to cater for an appropriate size for the grandson. Since we know these small pancakes (distance from the pot) and in diameter 2, we need to divide them accordingly.

Multiplying 8 large pancakes by their diameter gives us 4 large pancakes which have an area of 4 square inches (approximately equal to 6 large pancakes). To determine how few small pancakes Grandma's recipe will make, we need to split this region into equal smaller areas.

        "chain": "To answer, let's start by finding the area of each small pancake, which is the area of 1 large pancake including all sides (excluding the edges). Area of a circle = 10 inches Area of a rectangle = 20 inches Since we cannot make large pancakes, we will need to take the area and divide it by area to get the number of small pancakes using the formula. Area of 1 large pancake = 10 inches2 Area of 1 small pancake = 2 inches212 And for perimeter of all small pancakes: Area of 10 inch diameter area  width = (22)12(102)(202) Area of 1 large pancake = 25 square inches Total area of 8 large pancakes = 120 square inches Area in all small pancakes = 240 square inches The area distributed by 80 large pancakes = 480 square inches Therefore, Grandma's recipe will make roughly 480 small pancakes. Each small pancake would measure 2 inches in diameter and have an area of 10 inches and a circumference of 2. If there are multiple small pancakes, the total area will be 480 square inches. An alternative to solving for the area problem using the formula above, is to solve for the absolute value of the square root. For example, we can isolate the parameter \"\" by finding the lowest common multiple of 240 (LCM). Let's solve for the variable \"\": Area of 1 large pancake = 10 inches/2 = 20 inches/pancake Area of 1 small pancake = 25 square inches This will give us: Area of 1 small pancake = 25 square inches Area of 1 large pancake = 16 square inches The answer to this problem tells us that we can make 2 large pancakes, which are approximately 40 square inches long. Since we cannot make 480 small pancakes, we'll either need to adjust or write out a new problem entirely. This could involve varying the numbers of small pancakes (e.g., while adding up all the individual measurements) or making improvements to the original formula. In the meantime, keep in mind that the amount of small pancakes possible depends on a variety of factors, and determining the number of small pancakes required should be considered carefully.",

Now we can check this answer by multiplying 49 by 7 (the capacity of 1 box) to see that it reaches 349 (the net difference between the total number of brownies and the remainder), then canceling out to see if the difference reaches 0 (the rest is still there). 49 x 7 = 345 Therefore, the brownies must have been placed in exactly 49 boxes, each with 7 brownies in them, for a total of 478 brownies.",

To solve this, we can calculate the number of uniforms the store owner needs to buy by subtracting the number of uniforms purchased (583) from the total number of uniforms he already has: 97 - 583 =-5 This tells us that the store owner needs to buy 5 more uniforms to give each employee exactly 9 uniforms without any extras.

There are different methods to approach division problems, but 4 is the common method. For example, with long division: Write down 4 on one line and carry the other 2 in the right-hand column. With vertical division: Write down 7 on the left-hand column. Writing down 7 on the right-hand column. But keeping track of the subtraction gives you a more precise idea of how many boxes are needed. For example: - Write down 7 without spaces in them (four with \"3 on each column\") -- because that is what counts as division -- and get 3 out of those (so we can carry those over) - Write down the result in a column and carry the first space to the next column (leaving 3 leftover) Adding up: 4 + 3 + 7 + 3 -- 4 And working backwards, we see that 810 divided by 4 equals 200, so we need to round up to 200.

Therefore: 212.5 x 7 = $83.55 This means Vanessa would need $83.45 to buy the soda machine and all the sodas it can afford (24 per soda, plus an additional $0.45 in sales tax). To find out how many more quarters Vanessa needs to buy in order to have enough to buy a full machine, or drinks specifically, we can convert $85.00 to quarters and round up to $15.00. We know that she only needs $15.00, so we have $9.75 left to calculate the cost of purchasing the soda and shipping. If Vanessa is buying a total of 45 sodas (including a few left-over quarters) and leaving $7.25 remaining after buying the soda machine, then $31.41 is necessary.

To check this calculation, we can multiply the number of lawns by the charging price: 40 lawns x $3 per lawn = $117 This calculates very roughly, but it is important to note that since lawns can be very expensive, it's always important to find a way to accommodate everyone's budget and keep costs down.

The last part of the problem, which we can\u2019t yet address, is the question of how many entire rulers can also be made using 828 grams of plastic. To solve this as quickly as possible, we need to use a bit of permutation: 0.65 * 828 = 4 remainder 8 This tells us that the fraction of rulers that can be made with 828 grams of plastic needs to be balanced and in proportions to satisfy all of the conditions set down above. To address the remaining fraction, we need to make sure that 828 does indeed equals 828 (although the fraction currently being worked on may be smaller than 828) by finding the remainder of 8.28 which takes place only when 828 minus 828 is evenly divisible by 8.28. To actually find how many evenly this division yields, we\u2019ll divide 828 by 8 as follows: 828  8 * 8 = 828 828 - 8 = 80 This tells us that there are integers which indicate the maximum actual number of entire rulers that can be made, however, in practice the exact number will depend on the application of the plastic and the production method employed.",

However, if she wants to know the exact number of cans she needs to get the 873 quarters, we will have to subtract that from the original number. There is no specified number of cans in 103 cans, so we cannot find the final answer. Alternatively, we can think of 873 quarters as a whole number minus 1 that specifies how many cans of coke are needed.

By planting the same number of seeds each day, we can plant everyone but 1,2,3,4,5: Total number of seeds planted = 225 The number of seeds planted per day would be: No. of seeds planted / Number of days = 225 / 5 The ratio helps us to find our answer for this ratio. So we know that he planted 1,3,5,15 seeds per day, compared to the original number of 225 seeds he had planted. We could figure this out based on the number of children he brings with him at each planting. It's worth noting that some might have expressed this as a mathematical expression using division, but the real message is that we should think with absolute values while using ratios. Let's substitute the values we know into the equation: Seeds planted = Total number of seeds planted / Number of days Seeds planted = 225 The result is, therefore: Number of seeds planted per day = 180 / 5 This confirms our earlier calculation that he planted the same number of seeds every day.",

Area calculations are helpful for solving problems like this and provide an approximation for solving problems like this. Knowing that the width of the movie poster is 4 inches and the height is 7 inches, we can use the formula to find its area: Area = Width x Height = 4 inches x 7 inches Area = 28 square inches Therefore, the area of the movie poster is 28 square inches. The area formula uses the formula for area, which is A = lw (which means Area is a measurement of the surface area that is covered by one rectangle). To use this formula for your own poster, simply substitute the area value in the formula and simplify: Area = 28 square inches x 4 inches Area = 76 square inches The area of the poster is 76 square inches. This is much larger than the original width of the poster and closer to the center of the rectangle, making it easier to see in greater detail what is happening.",

Then, using the combination of 5 and 4, we can write an equation: 5/4 = 35/x Cross-multiplying, we get: 4(35) = 4(35) Distributing the multiplication, we get: 40 = 4(35) Divide each side by 4: x=7 Therefore, there are a total of 49 parking spaces in this parking lot.",

To determine the total number of spaces, we need to add the number of empty spaces to the number of taken spaces: - Number of empty spaces = 5x = 5(1) * 35 This gives us the total number of areas. We can now solve for the total numbers: Total = num. of empty spaces + num. of taken spaces Total = 35 + 7 Solving for the total, we get: total_area = 95 Therefore, there are 95 spaces in total.

Therefore, the total number of available parking spaces would be: 5 empty spots  4 taken spots = 35 empty spaces Next, you need to understand how many of each type of space are in use, such as extra spaces or overflow uncovered spaces. Without more information, let's just say there are x number of spaces that are filled with water or used to store items. We didn't actually know the quantity at that point in the scenario, so let's use it as a basis for understanding everything. Let's assume all of the x empty and used spaces are the same, so 5x empty spot = 55 and used space = 24 (since 35  4 spaces = 240). According to the problem, there are 5 empty and 4 taken spots, so y=35  4 spaces per x. Now we can use this equation to solve for i.e. what is i.e. how many total spaces there are. Plugging y=24 into our equation: x=55 / 5x Dividing both sides by 5, we find: num(num(x)=4 mx = 7 Now we can add z=48 and divide both sides by 7.5: x = 81 So there are 81 total parking spaces in the lot. Therefore, if you want to calculate the number of empty and take/used spaces in the lot, you can simply multiply 5x by 4 to get the total number of parking spaces: 5x = 8*77 5x = 428 128 x = 77 Therefore, the total number of available spaces would be 81, as mentioned in the question.",

First, we can set up a proportion: 8/3 = 32/x Here, \"x\" represents the total number of apples sold. We're using this proportion to find the fraction of red apples sold. We will use that \"x\" to set up a proportion: x/32 = 8/3 Next, we can use this proportion as our starting point by setting up the proportion. For each given quantity, we know that the ratio of red to green apples sold is 8/3 which simplifies to 32: 3.14 Rounding 9.8 up to the nearest hundredth, we can simplify to: 6/8 = 8/8 The result of this division is 9.8 or approximately 44. So 33 were red apples sold (8/12), and 4 were green apples sold (3/12). To find the combined sum of red and green apples sold at the store, we simply add these 2 quantities: 32 + 46 = 58 It is interesting to note that the proportion of red and green apples sold is a useful ratio \u2013 especially for people who are trying to calculate the total number of items sold. If the ratio of red to green apples is 8:3, then the question is asking for the total, not the quantity of red and green apples sold. Also, having said that the ratio is 8:30, one might wonder if there is another way to approach the problem: 8/3 = 32/3 Number of green apples sold in this scenario is 32/3 which is equivalent to 52/7, however, the fraction of \"red\" apples sold is 9/8. Trying \"5/6, then\"... -> 3/8 + 9/8 = 4/5 -> 4/5 = 0.667 \"5/6 = 7.84\" So, we can see a proportion with that quantity here: x (the number of red apples sold) is 7/8 of total number of produce store selling numbers (24.5) and 0.565 apples(0.365-0.667) which is a fairly large range for this type of math.

We can use this ratio to solve for x: If we sell 3 pairs of socks (we can't purchase 2 pairs of shoes without knowing the exact number we're selling), we need to distribute 1.8 shoes between first and secondhand sales: 1.8*x = (3*2)/x 90/x = 3*5 90/x = 10/8 x=8 This means that there are 28 pairs of shoes left over to sell (despite finding a balance with the distribution). We can subtract this amount from the number of secondhand sales to find x: 360=90-18=8 So, there are 40 pairs of sandals sold. To check our answer, we can see that the difference between shoes and sandals doesn't equal 1: The ratio of shoes to sandals doesn't match, so we conclude that the pair sold is not equal: 8 pairs = 30 slacks for 72 shoes 70 pairs = 30 pairs for 90 sandals So there are 30 + 90 = 82 pairs of sandals sold.",

Another way to think about this is to recognize that a proportion of how many bags is needed depends on how many sets of 7 pieces there are in each bag. If we want to know how many sets of 7 pieces there are in each bag, we divide 4 by 7, and then multiply 2 (5 by 2) by 7 (since we cannot have 2 whole sets of 7 there) to get 49: 28  7 = 3 bags This means that Frank would have enough bags for all of his candy, but since he already has 6 bags, he will have some extra left over.

The formula for division is: 42  7 = 6 bags This means it would take 6 bags in total for 42 pieces of candy to be placed in each bag. It can also be helpful to imagine another way to approach the problem. For example: You can use division to set up pieces of math that keep track of the total number of pieces: 42 divided by 7 equals 6 with a remainder of 5. This tells you how many sets of 7 would be required, meaning you could have 6 bags altogether if all the pieces fit. Remember that 9 bags of candy would be equally split, with 4 leftover pieces that wouldn't be evenly distributed among the 6 bags. Extra tip: To make sure you have enough candy to fill them up completely, you can multiply all 6 bags by the total number of pieces: 6 bags * 7 pieces per bag = 42 pieces of candy 4 bags * 7 pieces per bag = 52 pieces of candy Finally, to confirm your answer, confirm that if you did add the remaining items, you still ended up with 6 bags: 6 bags + 52 pieces of candy = 72 pieces of candy",

We know that there are 2 girls and 9 boys who dressed as ghosts, so we can add them to get the total number of people who dressed in ghost costumes. To do this, we can start by adding 2 (the girls) and 9 (boys), which gives us: 2 + 9 = 11. That tells us that based on the information in the problem, there are 11 people who actually dressed as ghosts (9 boys and 2 girls). Another way to conceptualize this is to imagine that each person dressed as a ghost mask based on the concept of ghost masks. If 2 girls wear ghost masks (2 girls wear ghost masks and so on), and 9 boys wear ghost masks (9 boys wear ghost masks), then the total number of people at the Halloween party who dressed as ghost masks can be found simply by adding the number of girls and boys. If we assume that everyone at the party (boys and girls) has dressed up as ghost masks, then 11 (the total) implies there are 11 costumes total. One possible way to check our answer would be to add up the number of girls and boys who dressed up as ghost masks for sure. One assumption might be that some kids dressed up as ghost masks because it's safe to assume that all of them actually liked doing this. However, based on our observations, this is just one possible way.",

The problem tells us that she had 72 nickels to start with, and we want to know how many stacks of 8 she could make.

Since we know she can't make partial stacks, we know there won't be enough nickels left over to give us a whole number of stacks. So in total, we can make 12 stacks with 8 nickels each. Now we divide 12 by 8 (5 cents per stack) to get 6. That's close, but not exactly enough. We can't make half a stack, so we know Lana cannot make half a stack.

For example, if we were looking for the fair price, we might try dividing 355 by 6 to get the value to 7 (since we did not multiply the value by the number of weeks). For example, we could divide 355 by 4 like this: 355 / 4 = 71 Since it's more difficult to determine an average than 71 by itself, we wouldn't want to include any decimals. Perhaps we should round down because we wanted to have a whole number for the mean. However, since the actual mean would be different depending on how many bars we sold per week, we should just round up because 355 is way more than 7 (since 355 was a whole number that didn't make sense).

You also won't have enough pizza toppings to go around everyone else, since you can't have partial pizzas after it's been sold.

Therefore, the mean number of pizzas sold is 4. This means that for every 6 hours of operation (pudding, sausage, cheese, mushroom, anchovies, and pineapple, there is an average number of pizza sold per hour). Alternatively, to find the mean we can use two simple equations: pp = (d/x) * 6 Where: d is the mean of the perceivable numerical value (e.g., P(x+6+P+6,C(10+6,O+6+2)2, F(i*6/6) and P(x+36,C10,O+56; )str((ip/24+c9,C10,O+36), F(i*46+c9), F(i*24+c9,F)) Finally, we divide the sum by other numbers to find the uniform value, which is 4. (e.g. 9 for 92/5=41.9, P=51.9, P=55.75, P=53/5=2.49, P=57.46, P=53/5=0.23, P=57.46 and _7 =0.75 This means that, on average, John's Pizza Palace sold about 0.56 pizzas per minute during their 6 hours of operation (468/6) per hour. One suggestion: You could also use average value of those additional pizza toppings to find the mean: P = 468 / 6 = 5.251 (for pepperoni and sausage) P = 5.651 / 6 P = 5.22 (for cheese) P = 5.654 (for sausage) P=5.039 (for cheese) P = 5.659 (for pineapple) And since you are asked for the mean we can use the common multiple in this problem or the value obtained by multiplying with your values: P = 5.57",

To find the GCF of these 2 numbers, we identify the common prime factors and multiply them together. The common prime factors are 2 and 2, so the GCF of 20 and 16 is 22.

If we chose 4 classrooms, each classroom would receive 4 flyers and 4 buttons. Therefore, the greatest number of classrooms Joanne can distribute materials to is 16. Alternatively, we could set up a table or chart to organize the available materials and give instructions to each classroom to make things easier: 1. Identify each classroom\u2019s needs: For classroom 1, we can write out what materials are needed per classroom by listing out various items on the table. For classroom 2, we will find out how many types of materials are needed in each classroom by counting the items on the table.

Divide the materials equally among those classrooms using the same table or chart: For classroom 5, we divide the materials equally among those classrooms using the same table or chart. For classroom 6, we divide the materials equally among those classrooms using the common table or chart. In this case, we choose the larger number since each classroom will have exactly what material they need without any remainder.

To calculate the GCF, we can find the common factors of 20 and 16: 4 x 2 = 8 The highest common factor (HCF) is 1, which means that any number greater than 4 will have the same coefficient. We see this as the smallest positive integer that is a factor of both 20 and 16.

Divide each factor into their common factors: Identify the common factors raised to the lowest power. Common factors are 1, 3, 9 and 18. 5. If we let the common factors all equal to 3 as 18, then 3 must be a multiple of 18 or 36, and therefore therefore the number of grapes that Edeena can pack must be a multiple of 3, 54 or 6.

We choose 9 glasses because it is the largest, and 6 mugs because they are small. We'll round down to 2 groups since having 2 glasses and 6 mugs is more efficient. Using the largest number that appears at the beginning of the problem (9 glasses and 6 mugs) makes the entire process fast and efficient. Therefore, we choose 9 as the largest number we have. To see why, let's take a look at some examples: 1. Take a look at the first set of glasses. 9 glasses are larger than 1 (31.5\") in some contexts (you could divide some other objects equally between them). Notice that this makes perfect sense since taking more glasses gives you more items than 1 mug, leaving you with unused items. 2. If we take out 1 set of glasses and put 1 set of mug aside, we know there will be unused items remaining after us: - If we take out 2 sets of glasses, we don't have enough in the first group - If we take a look at the first set of mugs and we don't see any unused items, we don't have enough in left over: - We'd rather have one more matching set than 2 and having 2 left over means we don't have enough left over to start with these items. 3. Bring down the remaining items and try increasing the number of sets: - We put out 1 set and 1 set of glasses before applying some other 1 in other groups; 1 set earlier than initially anticipated so we won't need those same 2 sets - So taking away one set gives us -8 while keeping 4 glasses while gathering used items. 4. When we use 2 sets of glasses, we have 1 set and some glasses left over while using up 1 of mugs. 5. Finally, when we take out 3 sets of mugs, we still have 1 set of mug remaining. Therefore the easiest condition is 4 complete sets of 2 glasses and 3 mugs. Using 2 sets and a minus 1 set result, we see everything is set with unused items.

In either case, the store should have sold 6 identical sets of hand towels (97 x 17 = 612) as well as 17 identical sets of bath towels, with each store having 8 identical sets of hand towels sold (77 x 6 = 780).",

        "chain": "Let's call the smallest number of each type of towel the store must have sold \"x\". We know that the stores sold an equal number of hand and bath towels, so: 17 (hand towels) f.b. 6 (bath towels) = x This tells us that both sets of hand towels and bath towels sold must have been identical. To find the lowest value of x, we can work backwards: If we know x, we can look for the least common multiple he is divisible by both 17 and 6. One common multiple of 17 and 6 is: 17 = 32 12 = 17 This tells us that x is a multiple that is multiple of either 17 or 6. If we know x, we can find the smallest number that does indeed = multiple. Looking backwards, we might find another common multiple: 29 = 170 This means x must be 170 and a multiple of both 17 and 6, since a multiple of each and multiples of each plus one at one time would likely result at a product that is 170. That's why we need the smallest possible value of x. First step is to solve for x. We can find a multiple of 17 by listing out multiples of each and finding their common multiple: Multiples of 17: 17, 34, 51, 68, 81, 85, 102, 119, 136, 153, 170 The more all-inclusive multiple means that a prime number cannot exist between 4 and 16. The smallest multiple of 17 that is also a multiple of 6 must not be divisible by both 6 and 17. To check, we can see that the store sells about 225 hand towels each (27 x 2) and 18 bath towels each (17 x 6). That leaves us with a complete set of 17-set (16 x 3) hand towels and 6-set (6 x 3).

But this time only covers the distance of the circle, and we need to ensure that it maintains the same speed over the entire trajectory of the ride. Let's assume a constant speed of 24 miles per hour for both riders. We know that their speeds will change over time, as their speed adjusts. Assuming that each rider maintains a constant speed over the entire distance of the circle, their distance traveled can be predicted by following the steady rate of the first rider's speed over the course of the course. So the speed is constant for both. Hence, this constant speed should not be underestimated, provided the riders maintain the same rate of travel in the same time frame.

It is important to note that while the LCM of 12 and 18 is 36, it only works on a circular path. If one biker completes two rounds, the rate at which the other biker completes additional rounds will be measured in minutes. Therefore, we need to adjust the LCM according to the given time intervals and keep using the same initial position. In this case, the time spent between first and last laps is the same, so the formula for LCM is: time = (112 minutes  84 minutes)  (268 minutes p.m.) LCM(1/12). -(18 minutes  84 minutes) = -36 times  timer(1) = 61 - Therefore, first and second attat will meet again at the starting point after 81 minutes. We cannot predict the time intervals perfectly, as we cannot calculate when laps change after one round completes another and when laps change due to delays in other laps. Assuming that both riders simultaneously meet at around the same point on the circular path, we can calculate the number of laps completed by each rider after completing two rounds. The information given in the problem tells us that half laps traveled by the first rider and half at the second could be covered in two separate laps. Let's assume for now that laps start at 0 and end at 81 minutes respectively. Based on the calculated time intervals, we can assume they will meet again at the starting point after 81 minutes when total laps are completed with no remainders or limitations. Therefore, LCM(2,611) = time = (18 minutes  84 minutes) divided by both number of rounds completed. This means that after 81 minutes, both will meet back at the starting point or change sides.",

To cut the strips on the 44-inch paper, we just need to divide 44 by 8. - The second factor that 33 makes is 9. - We can simply round this down to 11 because that's the largest whole number that's divisible by both 44 and 33. - In this case, we just need to round down to 11, which matches the highest common factor (HCF) of the two numbers. - So we saved 11 square inches of paper by cutting 16 strips from the first paper and 11 strips from the second paper.",

If we let some students choose the same number of girls on each team (e.g. 5, 25), we may not reach the greatest number of teams we wanted. Therefore, the greatest number of teams we could create is 5, since the first number that could be divided evenly between girls and boys is 5. However, we should try to group the students as evenly as possible, as any such quotient would leave some students without a fair distribution. Specifically, try giving equal numbers of girls and boys on each team if there are not enough girls to make equal teams. Alternatively, try increasing the number of girls by the same factor as the boys: - If we let some students choose the same number of girls as boys in each team (e.g. 5, 25), we will see how many teams we can form.

We achieve this by selecting 3 and creating division with less number of teams: - If 2 teams are formed, each team should have 6 students (5 girls + 2 boys) and 3 (3 boys + 3 girls) with equal numbers of each. - When using the 6:tskn(5skt,k8n,)pd(3,",

To find the GCF (greatest common factor), we multiply the number of unique items (11) by the same factor that is 1. So, we have: 2 x 1 = 2 x 3 (one of Destiny's items). Next, we need to check whether we can divide the 2 items into groups of 1 or 2. If we divide the 2 items into groups of 1, we will have: 3 x 2 = 6 (one of Destiny's items) 3 x 4 = 12 (one of Destiny's items) Therefore, Destiny can make a maximum of 6 identical snack bags.

Therefore, Destiny can make a maximum of 2 identical snack bags with either box of 18 chocolate candy bars or pack of 12 cookies. To determine the number of candy bars in each bag, Destiny can divide the total number of candy bars by the GCF: - $21 = 3 - $18 = 4 If Destiny wants to divide the candy bars into groups of 3, she can do that by finding the smallest common factor that they share (36). That means she can easily divide up the chocolate candy bars into 2 groups of 2, bringing the total number of snack bags to 3 (16 cookies  3 groups = 9 candy bars per bag). And she can also do the same with the cookies: - There are 3 groups of 3 chocolate candy bars in the box (6 candy bars  3 cookies per bag = 2). But since we can't make half a bag, Destiny needs to round down to the nearest whole number. She could try doing 3 identical snack bags, each containing 3 chocolate candy bars and 2 cookies, or she could use alternative methods such as counting by finding the largest factors in each group that fit within 2 digits. Therefore, Destiny should choose the former method for a greater number of identical snack bags she can make because it's easier and quicker to count by herself than by selecting a random group of discrete numbers based on random primes.",

But we can also check if their ringing times are consistent: In other words, if they don't ring together in the first 45 minutes, they may not ring together every other time. This also depends on the relative speed of the second clock (or the time it takes for them to ring together again), which could change in different ways depending on their individual frequency.",

Next, we need to find the prime factors shared by both 100 and 40. We can find the highest common factor of 200 and 360 by taking the greatest common factor of 1,000 and multiplying 2000 by 200. This factor is 1200. Cross-multiplying, we get: 200 * 200 = 10000 This tells us that every 10000 callers will win both a $100 bill and a Jingle Ball ticket. We should also note that the number of callers still left to call before someone wins both the $100 bill and the Jingle Ball ticket must be consistent. For example, if we multiply 2040 by 100, we get: 2040  100 = 1600 This also tells us the same thing \u2013 every 2040 caller will win both a $100 bill and a Jingle Ball ticket.

Melanie has an 8-inch track, which adds up to 48 inches long. Therefore, the shortest track her train could construct would be 48 inches long, made up of y-shaped pieces of 8-inch track. Since the shortest track they can build would be the same length, we don't want to distract Martin from building the track long enough so that he could build a different length of track based on his request. At the same time, at the least restrictive time, we'd like to have as much flexibility as possible with our 8-inch track construction. Perhaps we could see if some of Melanie's 8-inch pieces could be joined to form a right-angle track? Melanie might be interested in working with short track construction methods as well and perhaps constructing longer track sections to accommodate her larger pieces of gear. However, 12/18 = shortest track The solution comes from having an even number of integers that divide evenly into both integers. If x or y divide exactly into an integer value, then the least common multiple (LCM) between these unique integers is 0(102) \u2013 1, which simplifies up to 1. Consequently, the least common multiple is 1, which is 0. As we found earlier, 8, 16, 24, 32... and so on. Another way to approach the problem in this direction is to use prime factors like 1, 2, 4, and so on, finding their lowest common multiples or determining their least common multiples exactly. While using the LCM concept, we maximize the least common multiple resulting from matching integers and the prime factors they share and set up a multiple of 2. Multiples of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15,... and 20, such that LCM containing only multiples of 2 or both can be expressed as integers (1) and multiplied by multiplying each other's unique features.

One way to find the LCM is to list out multiples of each number until we find the first common multiple. Multiples of 8 are: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40... Multiples of 20 are: 20, 40, 60... Therefore, the first common multiple of 8 and 20 is 40. This means that the shortest possible length that a track that Melanie builds with 8-inch track pieces could be 40 inches long, measured from the top to bottom and end at one point with a track length of 8 inches. To verify this, we can verify that 20 is a factor of both 8 and 8: 80 is not a factor of 8; therefore, it cannot be divided into 2 halves. 80 -8 = 10 So the shortest track that Melanie could build would be 40 inches long between the top and bottom end, with an additional 5 inches added at one point. Additionally, to verify that this track is the same length as Martin's own build, we need to make sure that the total number of track pieces is the same for both lengths of the track. Melanie has joined one 8-inch track piece to another in this way so the total number of track pieces is the same for both lengths. Both tracks will be 40 inches long.",

To double check that this solution is correct, we can see that both methods of measurement give the same answer of 40 inches. However, measuring at 40 inches instead of 8 inches gives us an answer that is approximately 40 feet long. Therefore, we know that Melanie's track would be 40 inches long, and Martin's track would also be 40 inches long if he used 40 individual track pieces. Also, 20 is a factor of 4, which means it is a factor of 4 when used in combination with 8-inch track pieces.

To determine when they meet in the starting line, we need to know the total time it takes to complete each leg of the journey. Thus, we can use a heuristic formula: Total time = 2 H + (time to complete each leg) Distance traveled = H  12 Distance traveled = 6  9 = 11.7 Rounding this to 3.14, we get: Distance traveled = (2/18)  9.25 This means that they will meet at the starting line after 19. To check our work, we can calculate how many minutes that equals meeting time using a simple equation: Total time = distance traveled  [time to complete each leg] Substituting the given values for the distance traveled = (1/18)  9.25 [13:47 pm for 'just before'] Multiplying the distance by 9: Distance traveled = 37 feet Since they were both traveling around a circle, finding how long they have left to meet is crucial in our understanding of the time it takes to complete one lap. Therefore, we compute the following: distance traveled * time = rate * time distance/(rows of journey) Number of times = 7 minutes * 3.14 Number of times equals 21 miles (since all sections of a circle must be included) Time spent = 6 minutes Multiplying time by 9: time = 26 minutes Therefore, the answer is that there will be 26 minutes before they meet at the starting line.",

We do not have enough time to wait for their times together to be consecutive, so we need to adjust this timetable accordingly. At the beginning, it would take Henry 7 minutes to travel the distance of the track, meaning that 7 minutes divided by 7 will give us the time it takes for him to cover the distance he traveled (i.e. 7 minutes) while Margo takes 12 minutes to travel the same distance. This means that the only time it takes for them to meet once is when their time has passed. Thus, we calculate the time it will take for Henry and Margo to meet since the time it takes them to complete their journey will be the least common multiple of 7 and 12, which is 42. We can set up an equation such that: r and m = t where r is the length of the track under their movement. When m = t, and t = h, the sum of the distance each are covered by respective sides of the track equals the total number of times they covered altogether.

So adding 36 to one of the previous multiples will result in the least common multiple: - Multiples of 36 = 36 * 3 - Multiples of 36 = 90 Now we want to find the least common multiple (LCM) which is 9 so we use the first multiple after 90 to write the LCM: - Multiples of 34 = 90 The LCM of 36 and 90 is therefore 90, which also has 3 remainders, making it 60.

For example, if they desired a shorter length, they could have requested something shorter, such as 3m, 6m, or 12m, but there would still be a remainder on either of those choices. To find the shortest possible length of ribbon, we can set up the problems and see what length they end up with if there's no remainder.

Arranging the flowers: To do the right math calculations, you cannot combine 2 numbers, 84 and 2, so you need to look for other solutions. First, divide the total number of roses and daisies by the number of arrangements needed: 8 roses * 28 arrangements = 896 (which is the common multiple of 8, 12, and 48). Then divide the number of arrangements by 2, 3, and 6 to get out the total number of arrangements: 84 (the number with the highest 3 and 0 left)  6 (the 3 arrangements where there's no difference with the total number of flowers) => 687 / 3 = 90  1.

        "chain": "To begin, we need to understand how many types of cheese it takes to make a burrito and taco. Let's start by using ratios: - Since each burrito requires 4 ounces of cheese \u2013 we want to find out how many ounces of cheese is needed for 7 burritos based on this ratio \u2013 This means the number of burritos won't be exactly 7, but we will know how much cheese is needed for 1 taco since the ratios are different. Next, we will use proportions to figure out how much cheese is needed for 1 taco since it also requires 4 ounces of cheese. To start, we will use ratios: - Since each burrito requires 4 ounces of cheese, we will multiply the amount needed for 1 burrito by 7 (which is the required amount): - There will be cheese needed for:: - For 7 burritos, we will need: (2 x 5)/2 = 17.5 pounds Now we know that 17.5 pounds of cheese is needed for 7 burritos and 1 taco because: (2 x 7)/2 = 17.5 ratios During this ratio, there is no cheese in between the meat and toppings. Instead, since there is none in between, we decide the amount that must be there in order for us to make up the ratio of quantity needed for both items. To accurately compute the amount of cheese needed for both items, we can simply calculate the proportions:  Here, ratios tell us: (In ounces) of cheese needed for burrito + (5 x 4 ounces of cheese given in ratio)  Let's simplify this to: (15 / 4 ounces) = (9/1 mL) of cheese needed for burrito  For taco: (5 x 11 ounces of cheese provided = 7 / (18.5 ounces of cheese needed for taco  Knowing about ratios and consistency also helps us build the model for this problem... Now, let's solve for the amounts that need to be used for burritos and taco:  As we move through proportions and substitute in leads, we realize 15.5 pounds = 61.3 pounds.

Now, since it's given that it takes 4 ounces of cheese to make 7 burritos, we can use the variable \"amount of cheese needed\" to find the total amount required for both orders.

However, it's important to note that the report only mentions the time spent watching videos and not the time spent watching ads, so we could ask how much time was spent on ads specifically to exclude these factors from the total time spent on Youtube overall. In conclusion: Every day, people spent 17 minutes on Youtube, and particularly on watching 2 videos each, which brought home the point that the average viewer spent 17 minutes every day on Youtube.",

However, if the question specifies that time is spent in minutes, such as seconds, it can be useful to add 2 minutes to the amount drawn at school and 19 minutes to obtain the total minutes: 22 minutes + 19 minutes = 41 minutes You should arrive at the correct answer by adding the minutes spent drawing at school and at home separately, as shown below: 24 minutes + 41 minutes = 55 minutes Therefore, the total time that Bianca spent drawing in total was 55 minutes.",

Another way to think about it is to distribute the flowers as evenly as possible without having to worry about splitting them. If we divide the carnations into sets of 3, as we did, we'll only have 2 vases left in the pot.

Since he gave away such a large number of Skittles, it's hard to divide them evenly. It would be hard for Sam to divide them into equal groups. To figure it out, we need to group them into groups like this: 6 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 14 So before Samuel ate any Skittles, he had 14 - 6 = 3 Skittles left. Since we also know that he ate 6 Skittles, this tells us that each person got 6 Skittles. And we also know that he ate the remaining 3 Skittles after giving away the original 14. To check both of those values, we can add them together: 6 + 6 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 14 Simplifying further, however, we don't need to eat the remaining 3 or so Skittles. Each person got 6 Skittles.

However, we can't give someone half a Skittle, so we need to either round down to 1 or give something smaller to Sam, so that one person got 2 Skittle (or 3 altogether). With all the leftover Skittle pieces, Samuel must have given away 4 separate sets of Skittles to his friends.

Therefore, both friends would have received either 3 or 4 Skittles, as well as an unknown quantity of Skittle left over.

Take the total number of Skittles and dividing them by the number of groups: 8  4 = 2. Write down the number or the units of each Skittle that you started with and carry over the remainder: (-20)  8 = 2.5 Or, take the decimal place and simplify: 60 = 1/2 To ensure that each group has an equal amount of candy, you need to round down to 2 or 3. Leave the remainder an equal as follows: 4 [5] = 1.75 [5] left over for every round down, so you have 3 Skittles left over for every round up: 4 [5] = 0.75 [leftover] 3. Write the decimal place and check that the total number of allotted Skittle pieces matches the total number dividing: 30 (5 + 5) + 5 ( 6) + 6 (leftovers) = 32 (number of Skittle pieces she originally had) So, both Lillian and her classmates received an equal portion of 20 Skittles!",

To make matters even simpler, we could subtract the number of Skittles each person received from the total number of Skittles.

So the answer is that each friend would get only 6 tickets because it's not common or a fraction of a ticket. Assuming Tom only wants to raffle the tickets, he wouldn't be able to evenly distribute them among all of his 9 friends either because 6 tickets = 6, or he wouldn't be able to divide them evenly among the 9 friends since he only has 6 tickets for each friend.

Assuming each classroom has 10 students, this means that they will board 10 individual buses. To calculate the total number of buses needed, we need to know how many schools will be formed and make sure each group is participating in the field trip. Since there are only 11 classrooms, they will need about 5 buses in total, which is a bit on the expensive side ($40).

We can double-check this by multiplying the number of bananas per friend by the number of friends: 6 bananas per friend x 40 friends = 40 bananas This confirms that Virginia's bananas are being shared equally with 40 friends, with each friend receiving 4 bananas.",

It's important to note the division because we are trying to determine how many bananas each friend will get while still ensuring that everyone has an equal portion. Adding up the number of bananas each friend gets gives us a total of 40 + 4 = 44 (because there are 44 items to share without a fraction of a banana).

If Steven has 5929 Skittles, and has 11 erasers, we can perform the calculation: 5929  77 ------ 478 So each group of Skittles will be 77 Skittles long. Alternatively, we can approach this problem visually by labeling the parts of the collection that are common to each group: - 5902 Skittles - 11 erasers Overall, we arrive at this value by performing simple division using long division: - Divide the total Skittles (529) by the number of groups (97): - 54 Skittles  77 groups = 17 Skittles per group. Either way, we arrive at the same answer: each group of Skittles will be 77 Skittles long. Another way to visualize this problem is to draw a diagram of a binder filled with Skittles that represents a certain number of different sizes for varying amounts of effort. To use this method effectively, we can draw a bar chart representing different quantities of Snowballs, or organize by placing circles around the shape of an already existing group. For instance, we could add red dots in the shape of an envelope to help us keep track of the amount jarred jars. Another way to conceptualize this problem is to envision an orange bag with different colors. Knowing that the initial portion of the collection includes 5929 Skittles, we can use this to calculate their individual volumes. This corresponds to the numerical value stated above. For example, if we know the initial number of all the Skittles and try to find how many Skittles each container contains, we can create: 1 (total Skittles - started with assorted pink :sorted in assorted red dots color bar) - 2 (no pink ) to represent unknown contents stored inside a bag",
